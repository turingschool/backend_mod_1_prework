## Gear Up Pre-Work


_Our **mission** is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers._

### What is the purpose of Gear Up in Mod 0?

* Reflect on intersectionality and how your identity impacts your experiences and interactions with others
* Develop greater empathy and awareness of the experiences of others in the field of software development

### Pre-Work Preparation
#### Background Knowledge

Step 1: Watch this video from Google.
* ["Unconconscious Bias at Work"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW5s_-Nl3JE)

Step 2: If you are unfamiliar with the term "Implicit Bias," take time to read this article to build your background knowledge.
* ["PBS News Hour: Implicit Bias"](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/making-people-aware-of-their-implicit-biases-doesnt-usually-change-minds-but-heres-what-does-work)

#### Reflect
Create a gist on Github and reflect (4-6 sentences) on the following questions:

##### What were your reflections from the video?

I have a tendency to assume that everyone around me has similar opinions and watches the same news stations that I do. Logically, I know that this absolutely cannot be true. Unfortunately, the assumption that people will understand my perspective seems to happen on an emotional level rather than a logical one. Luckily, every human seems to fall prey to this pattern of thought at least once in their life. Development of ego is necessary for humans, or we would forget to feed ourselves as children. However, developing an awareness of the subjective nature of our own experience, and an awareness of how our actions impact the world around us remain hallmarks of maturity.

It is encouraging to see people like me (with "disabilities") thriving in this industry, and using it to make the world a better place for people with a wide range of abilities.

##### In what ways have you examined your implicit biases before coming to Turing?

Formal Implicit Bias trainings were mandatory at both Best Buy and in the healthcare industry. However, these trainings were not revisited regularly.
  - Unfortunately, the company culture at Best Buy reflected this lack of empathetic concern for their customers. *"You can't judge a person's credit limit by their appearance"* flew out the front door after a person of color with facial tattoos stole $3k worth of Bose products from our store.
  - In healthcare, several of my coworkers refused to treat patients due to rumors that they had molested children. This was harder to deal with, on an emotional level, as I had to put my own personal opinions aside and remember that my job was not to judge any of my residents, but to serve them.  
Personally, I've had to address the bad patterns that I learned from my own family and community. Believe it or not, my parents intended to raise a faithful and dutiful Catholic. Fortunately, I came out asking questions, and this did not bode well for my eternal soul, in their opinion. After parting ways with my Christian roots, I was absolutely stunned to see exactly how wrong they were about the true state of the world, and grace. This journey taught me that unlearning patterns that do not serve me (or the world, in my opinion) is inherently uncomfortable.
  - *Embrace learning that you're wrong! Fighting the lesson robs you of the wisdom it's trying to give you.*
  - I'm trying to eliminate "You should" from my vernacular. It tastes too much like youth group leaders trying to guide me away from realizing that I am LGBTQA+.
  - What I used to think sounded like grace and acceptance actually sounds like condescension and dismissal.
In college, they tried to coach us once or twice about overcoming our biases, but the tone was condescending and I don't remember much from it. It just didn't feel sincere to receive training about overcoming biases from professors who graded my male counterparts higher on their homework that was directly copied from mine.
  - I suppose my personal bias against the professors prevented me from listening to what they had to say. However, I maintain that my personal bias was indeed justified: I had personal experience with this particular professor, in which their actions did not reflect their promises. This was not an example of implicit bias - this was specific skepticism based upon experience. Allowing this specific experience to extend to all professors, *"All professors grade male-presenting students more favorably."* would create bias.
In both Psychology and Probability and Statistics, bias was addressed in a mathematical sense. We learned that the method by which data is collected affects the quality of the conclusions that can be drawn from the data. This concept is not intuitive.
  - *"Failing to account for bias is just bad science."*"
Ultimately, humans tend to be biased toward what they find familiar. This is not surprising. Think of it like working with variables. Once you have defined a variable, it is put into context, and can be worked with. Once a human has defined an experience, for example a trauma, they will attempt to use this data to approach the rest of the world with the intention of making things easier for themselves, and treat data that look similar, accordingly. A child who was once severely injured by a dog bite may generally avoid dogs for the rest of their life, or until a particularly sweet canine ignores the human's protestations and takes a nap in their lap. Ironically, this singular experience will not have the same effect as the dog bite, and it will not automatically reverse the fear that the human learns and practices throughout their life.
  - This is why saying, "I can't be biased! I have a _____ friend!" doesn't actually work.

##### What kind of software do you imagine building in the future? How will understanding biases (or avoiding understanding biases) impact your products?

I would like to write programs that people find easy to use, but also which foster their own development as a person without exploiting their humanity in order to make them addicted to the program.
  - I will have to expand my definition of "easy to use" beyond my own capabilities. Historically, I have tested ideas on friends and family members, but in the future, I will have to reach outside of my social circle, and ask for opinions from people which I do not easily understand.
  - I understand why TikTok is both popular and addictive, and I would like to be better than that. I would like the things I make to popular because they are useful, not addictive.
I have a mental block around designing something exclusively to maximize profit. I see nothing but animosity in this goal, and I historically cannot stay at companies which act contrary to my personal values.
  - Maintaining this bias will limit my possibilities, however this focus will allow me to better serve the my purpose.
I don't know how, but I would like to make the law and the ability to defend one's rights more available to people in general. If I do this, I am going to have to address both my bias against lawyers (thanks, Dad) and my bias against people that do not understand the legal system as well as I do. What feels intuitive to me is not to others. Rather than expecting my customers to learn how to use my tools, I hope to learn to make tools that the customers can easily learn to use.
  - Rather than blaming someone for taking time to learn, account and accommodate for the learning curve.

#### Reflect
On your same gist, reflect on the following quesitons:

<b>“All of us live complex lives that require a great deal of juggling for survival,” Carty and Mohanty said in an email. “What that means is that we are actually living at the intersections of overlapping systems of privilege and oppression.”</b>

 ##### When you consider the way you move through the world, what elements of your identity are you most aware of on a daily basis?

 - Before I found out I am autistic, the only thing I knew was that other people at large treated me like I am different, once they realize that I do not act as average as I look. After my diagnosis, a lot of things made sense.
 - I hate crowds and large gatherings. I prefer a little more space, which is why I live in a county with a low population. In crowds, I feel hyper aware of everyone around me, overwhelmed, and unable to function unless I view the world in "Minecraft Brain" where everything is simplified into blocks. If this doesn't kick in, my brain short circuits and my animal emotions take over, and they are not concerned with grace. It's embarrassing.
 - I'm small, compared to many humans around me.
 - I look like a girl. This is important because people that look like men see this, and expect me to act a certain way, with mild to severe penalties if I do not immediately meet expectations.
 - Someone is always looking at my butt. There is probably cat hair on my clothes, too.
 - I have to make eye contact with people, otherwise they will know I'm autistic and treat me like an object.
 - I can't fidget or people will think I am anxious and don't want to listen to what they have to say. This makes them angry, and angry people tend to treat me like an offensive object.
 - "Don't trust people or let them get close to you until you are sure they won't pick your pocket."
 - Most men that approach me will ask me something with sexual intentions in 5...4...3...2...
 - If I do not answer politely, there is a good chance a man will follow me and physically assault me. It's happened on more than one occasion in more than one place.
 - My voice annoys people, as do my words. Don't talk unless invited.
 - The moment I feel comfortable and stop masking, everyone else feels uncomfortable and the meeting is ruined.
 - "Talk like the people around you, otherwise they will see that you're autistic. Also, don't blurt out something too technical, or they will detect the autistic and ostracize you or worse."
 - The world is dangerous and people generally don't know that their "good intentions" can be incredibly harmful. Also, never believe anyone you just met who says they have the best intentions. They might be trying to pick your pocket.
 - As a white woman, I am problematic by virtue of existance. In fact, if I cry, I'm actually harming others. I take up too much space, get too much attention, and cause problems just by existing. I am supposed to shut up, follow along, also pay for everything (because apparently I look like I can...or should...or something), and be warm, empathetic, and inviting toward everyone.
  - It feels like I am supposed to fix everything any white person has done wrong before I can be perceived as valid. The perception that I am somehow insulated from the negative effects of prejudice due to the lack of melanin in my skin is inaccurate. Treating me as if my struggle is less valid than that of a person of color is not sensitivity or empathy. It's willfully ignorant negligence.
  - Every single person's struggles are different, but no less valid. Giving voice to all struggles, regardless of our perception of whether or not we think a person should be allowed to experience those struggles, is key. Similarly, giving credit and celebrating victories should not be restricted to any one "group," or the struggles will follow suit.
 - I do not fit my "role" and this consistently has negative consequences that I've had to learn to either move around or dismiss entirely, in order to function at all.

 ##### What strengths does your identity give you?  How will you utilize those at Turing?

 - Autistic "special interests" can be leveraged, here. Once I decide I am going to learn something (especially if I want to use it), there is no stopping me.
 - Since I have a bit more trust for the school and its faculty, and feel as if I have been accepted into the community as a person rather than as an object, I feel safe to explore what there is to be learned at this institution.
 - My need to approach social situations logically feels like it will be an advantage, but I do not know how, yet.
 - The ability to work from home feels safe. I can think, and when I can think, I can learn. Because I enjoy working remotely, I am good at leveraging technology to maintain relationships over distances.
 - I am a highly empathetic person. Empathy helps me work together with my team to remember to address our own human needs and limitations throughout the project. This helps keep the team's overall stress levels lower, and this leads to better products.
 - I have a strong desire to communicate, and am enthusiastic to learn new languages. Currently, I am trying to improve my Spanish fluency and learn ASL outside of Turing. I have friends who speak both languages, and want to be able to better understand them.
 - I am a bit of a magpie with knowledge. I love to learn, and I love finding connections and correlations between seemingly unrelated things. As much as I love organizing, I love tearing apart old structures and completely rebuilding them both in the physical world as well as the virtual one.

 ##### How do you think you could value the identies of those around you to bring out their strengths at Turing? Has there been a time where you were able to advocate or include people around you?

 *"You have two ears, and one mouth. Use accordingly." -Barbara Young, my neighbor*
 *"Even a fish would stay out of trouble if it kept its mouth shut." -Buddy Young, Barbara's Husband, Aveda Hairdresser Extraordinaire*
 - I was taught by my father to speak up (first, be assertive or you will be ignored) and stand up for my ideas. This does not leave much room for listening.
   - I still plan to speak up, but rarely first, as it's not yielded good academic or social results in my experience, and that does matter in these settings.
   - I will try to listen more, and to listen better.
    - I've been practicing. I used to "be bad at names" ie "bad at paying both attention and respect," but I am making a conscious effort to show people the respect of learning their names (and the way they prefer it to be pronounced).
   - Taking notes while people talk helps me focus on listening rather than (autistic) intrusive thoughts.

##### How will your strengths impact you as a teammate?  What will you bring to your cohort?

 - My general enthusiasm usually pervades groups I am working with. Relaxed brains think better!
 - Because I can detect when people are uncomfortable, but often cannot conclude why, I approach my team mates directly about uncomfortable situations. My confusion regarding social cues becomes a strength, because I have to listen to people when they explain their feelings and treat them like complex humans. This willingness to listen helps my teams to leverage our individual strengths and manage our limitations.
 - There will be little left to ambiguity, if at all possible, in groups I work with. I enjoy details and organization.
 - I have failed before. I know rock bottom. I don't tell people my whole story, often, because it's not easy to handle, and I don't needlessly subject people to my pain. However, since I know what it is to fail, hit rock bottom, and dance my way back to sunlight, I know what hope smells like. And I now that I know that failure isn't the end of me, I can't give up. If there is a way for a thing to be done, even if it seems backwards, I am willing to spend days and nights tearing apart my work in order to build something better.
 - I have experience in a wide variety of fields, and I look forward to applying every ounce of it to me journey with Turing. Like Steve Jobs said, *"you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life."*
