# Career Journal: Alexandra Kaudy

### Mod 0
1. When you've worked towards a goal in the past, what systems or tools have been helpful for you in accomplishing that goal? How could you adapt those same systems/tools to use while at Turing?

  - I am excellent at calendaring. This has already proven to be a useful skill outside of Turing, and I doubt it will work to my detriment, here. Maintaining a realistic living document of how time is planned and spent is essential to the success of almost any living project, such as a website.
  - Regular meetings with the team to share progress status, ask questions to the group at large in a formal setting, revisit the team's goals, and revise deadlines accordingly are essential to the success of any project. These meetings absolutely must foster communication, and can not be team leader monologues or rants.
  - "Make a plan, right or wrong." is always the first step in any project.
  - I am excellent at documentation. "Redundancy is key!" was drilled into my brain in middle school science class, as we wrote our lab notebooks. I like to keep both documentation of what I am working on, as well as up-to-date backup copies, should disaster strike.

2. As you start this new career, what is one of your strengths and how do you know?

  - I am thoroughly determined.
  - Although this sounds less systematic than stubborn, I am good at asking the same question many different ways until I receive and answer that is satisfactorily informative. I am thorough, and this will definitely help while learning to debug broken code.
  - I know that I possess this trait because many people have complained to me about it. I view it as a strength because it helps me.
    - I have used this strategy to unearth dishonesty in my personal relationships and professional life. Usually, the person who was invested in my deception is the person who complains. In the end, I unearth the truth, or a solution, which would have otherwise been hidden.

3. Describe how you work best (conditions, environment, preferences, etc.):

  - I work best remotely, but with a team.
  - Collaboration is far more engaging than competition, for me. While I can work alone on projects in an office, I struggle to work without progressive input from somebody, whether they are collaborators or fellow creators.
  - I have health restrictions which make working in an office disruptive, so the freedom to address my own health needs in privacy allows me to complete my work without additional social anxiety, and while maintaining my dignity.
  - Regular team meetings, and consistent communication in the interims, are essential to my teams success.
  - I work best in teams where immediacy is valued, but this is balanced with healthy boundaries between professional and personal life.
    - I make myself unresponsive outside of work hours, short of real emergencies which involve people dying.
    - I recognize that my previous practice of making myself constantly available was detrimental to my own development as well as to the quality of my work.

4. As you start this new career, what is your greatest area of improvement when it comes to your professional skills?

  - I still struggle with self discipline, and this will likely be the area in which I will be forced to improve. Although I have made great progress, it is still difficult to self regulate without the assistance of external timers. The Pomodoro timer and goal-oriented calendar system are already improving this.
    - Maintaining boundaries between my personal life and professional life has been difficult since I started working when I was 15. My family will go to nearly any lengths to get what they want, including lie to me about a medical emergency to get me to come home from work and attend to them. Because of poor boundaries in those foundational relationships, I am still learning that it is professional to maintain boundaries. This will be difficult to get used to, as the professional environments to which I am accustomed are unhealthy and lack boundaries. This is actually a large part of why I am pursuing my education with Turing.


5. How will developing a deeper understanding of your strengths and working preferences benefit you as a software developer?

  - As I work to understand my own strengths, I look forward to both exploring and developing them. Identifying persistence as a strength, for instance, rather than a weakness, allows me to overcome the shame and guilt associated with persistent behavior, and gives me the freedom to find ways in which that persistence can be best applied.
  - As a developer, I can only anticipate the work will require levels of persistence which I have not yet reached. I look forward to seeing what I'm capable of in seven months.  

6. Describe the vision you currently have for your career after Turing:

  - I envision my career after Turing as a dynamic one. We are no longer in the age in which it is considered a success to work your way up from the bottom of same company for decades and expect to retire comfortably. This may be possible for some, but as hard as I've tried to make this work for me, I simply could not handle the disparities behind corporate advertising and their realistic practices.
  - I would like to work as a junior developer for a mid-size company, at first.
  - I anticipate continuing my education, informally, and want to develop the skills necessary to work as a full stack developer.
  - Assuming I perform well, I expect that I will continue to work within the company company I start at as a software developer. However, if the company does not have a position available, and I feel my skills would better serve elsewhere, I plan to move on rather than waiting for an opportunity to present itself.
  - Assuming I perform well, I anticipate building my skills and working as a developer for several different companies throughout my career. As I build my skills and learn new languages, I hope to work as a lead developer.
  - I plan to return to school, eventually, in order to build skills necessary to become a project manager, and work on larger projects.
  - I anticipate that when I feel financially secure enough, I will start my own business.
