##  I believe in each section the term "deliverables" is mentioned:

### Section1
> no mention of deliverables

### Section2

> Look back at that special spot in your notebook for vocabulary. Hopefully you updated it with definitions, diagrams, and code samples as you went through this section. If not, do so now. This will be part of this sections deliverables.

### Section3
>no mention of deliverables

### Section4
 >The article doesn't mention writing down Step 1, but we ask that you find a special spot in your notebook where you do this for each work session. In the deliverables, we will ask that you share what you wrote down for Step 1 of the technique each time you started a new task. _Note: if the 25 minutes on/3-5 minutes off isn't best for you, you do **not** have to follow that! The main focus of this is setting an intention and continuing to better understand your working style._
