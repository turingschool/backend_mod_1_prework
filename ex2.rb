# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by ruby

puts "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

# you can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# puts "This won't run."

puts "This will run."

# Here, the OCTOTHORPE is not ignored because it is within a string.
# It looks like the octothorpe denotes an empty hash, but I am not sure.
puts "Hi #{} there!"
