# Study Drills

# We know that Jan 1, 2010 is really in 2010  and not 2009 because, if we place all
# days of the year into an array, like days_of_a_year = [1..365], with January 1
# in the "0th" position in the array, it is not possible to put Jan 1 as the 366th day of the
# previous year.

# Write your own array and index.
