# Your function should include an if/else statement that meets the following criteria
#   - Danger levels that are above 50 are too scary for your hero. Any danger
#     level that is above 50 should result in printing the bad_excuse to the terminal

# Reflection
# What parts were most difficult about this exerise?
# Defining the methods and correctly formatting them was super difficult.
# Had trouble with gain_power referencing variable power_level...*

# What parts felt most comfortable to you?
# Variables, math, arrays, and hashes felt comfortable.

# What skills do you need to continue to practice before starting Mod 1?
# I could use more practice with methods.
