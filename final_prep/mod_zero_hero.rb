# Declare two variables - hero_name AND special_ability - set to strings

#   - bad_excuse should be a string a hero would say if they are too afraid of the danger_level

# Your function should include an if/else statement that meets the following criteria
#   - Danger levels that are above 50 are too scary for your hero. Any danger level that is above 50 should result in printing the bad_excuse to the terminal
#   - Anything danger_level that is between 10 and 50 should result in printing the save_the_day string to the terminal
#   - If the danger_level is below 10, it means it is not worth your time and should result in printing the string "Meh. Hard pass." to the terminal.

# Reflection
# What parts were most difficult about this exerise?
# The class section

# What parts felt most comfortable to you?
# Everything up until the class section

# What skills do you need to continue to practice before starting Mod 1?
# I need to fully understand all the components of a class. Dynamic and static values was new.
