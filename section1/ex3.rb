# Exercise 3: Numbers and Math

# print the statement.
puts "I will now count my chickens:"

# print 'Hens', compute equation in brackets and print the result.
puts "Hens #{25.0 + 30 / 6}"
# print 'Roosters', compute equation in brackets and print the result.
puts "Roosters #{100.0 - 25 * 3 % 4}"

# print the statement.
puts "Now I will count the eggs:"

# compute the equation and print the result.
puts 3.0 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6

# print the question asking if something is true.
puts "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"

# compute the equation resulting in true or false and print the result.
puts 3.0 + 2 < 5 - 7

# print the question, compute equation in brackets and print the result.
puts "What is 3 + 2? #{3.0 + 2}"
# print the question, compute the equation in brackets and print the result.
puts "What is 5 - 7? #{5.0 - 7}"

# print the statement.
puts "Oh, that's why it's false."

# print the statement.
puts "How about some more."

# print the question, compute the equation in brackets resulting in true or false. Print that result.
puts "Is it greater? #{5 > -2}"
# print the question, compute the equation in brackets resulting in true or false. Print that result.
puts "Is it greater or equal? #{5 >= -2}"
# print the question, compute the equation in brackets resulting in true or false. Print that result.
puts "Is it less or equal? #{5 <= -2}"
