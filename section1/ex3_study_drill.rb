# Exercise 3: Study drill

# print the question.
puts "How many total family members do I have?"

# declare the variable and assign it with an integer
mom_num = 1
dad_num = 1
aunt_num = 4
uncle_num = 3
first_cousin_num = 6

# compute the addition equation and print the result.
puts mom_num + dad_num + aunt_num + uncle_num + first_cousin_num + second_cousin_num + sister_num + brother_num

# print the question.
puts "How many brothers and sisters do I have?"

# compute the addition equation and print the result.
puts brother_num + sister_num

# print the question, compute the equation in brackets and print the result.
puts "Is it true that I have more first cousins than second cousins? #{first_cousin_num > second_cousin_num}"
