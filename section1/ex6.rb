# Study Drills
# 1. completed
# 2. Located 4 spots where strings are placed within strings
# 3. There were instances of creating and assigning string values, and there
# are instances of creating a string and placing another string within it
# 4. From what I'm seeing online, this is called Concatentation - process of
# appending one string to the end of another string.
# 5. In the instance of joke_evaluation, using single quotes will not work due
# to there already being a single quote used in the contraction "Isn't". There
# would need to be another way of working around that. For the other instances,
# the single quotes can be used without worry.
