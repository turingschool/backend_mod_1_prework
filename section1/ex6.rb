# Find all the places where a string is inside the string
# Answer: anywhere you said #{...} inside quotes. Yes, there are only 4.

# Answer: it combines two sides of the string together using "+"

# What happens when you change the strings to use ' (single-quote) instead of " (double-quote)?
# Do they still work? Try to guess why.
# Answer: No, because the double quote is the code for a string. You can use single quotes inside of the double quotes though.
