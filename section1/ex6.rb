# Study Drills
#1 Add comments above each line explaining it.
#2 There are 4 strings inside a string.
#3 Line 10 has 2. Line 18 has 1. Line 20 has 1. Strings are in "" or ''. Variables can equal strings.
#4 Adding the two strings w and e with + makes a longer string because it adds the value/string attached to each variable and puts them together.
#5 If I use '' instead of "", it still works unless there are quotes within quotes, which have to be "''".
