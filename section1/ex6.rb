# Gives variable a value of 10
types_of_people = 10
# Defines the variable with a string and inputs variable "types_of_people"
x = "There are #{types_of_people} types of people."
# Defines binary variable as a string

# Defines do_not variable as a string
do_not = "don't"
# Defines y as a string and inputs "binary" and "do_not" variables
y = "Those who know #{binary} and those who #{do_not}."

# Prints variable x
puts x
# Prints variable y
puts y

# Prints string with variable "x" input
puts "I said: #{x}."
# Prints string with variable "y" input
puts "I also said: '#{y}'."

# Defines variable "hilarious" as false
hilarious = false
# Defines variable as a string and inputs "variable" hilarious
joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! #{hilarious}"

# Prints variable joke_evaluation
puts joke_evaluation

# Defines the variable "w" as a string
w = "This is the left side of..."
# Defines the variable "e" as a string
e = "a string with a right side."

# Concatenates/adds strings in variables "w" and "e"
puts w + e

#Study Drills:

#There are more than 4 places that a string is inside of a string if you count the variables
# w and e concatenates the strings together
# there is not interpolation with single quotes so some of the computations will not work
