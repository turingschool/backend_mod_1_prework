# Here's some new strange stuff, remember type it exactly.

# assigns a string values to days
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
# assigns a string of values to months when printed all create a new line except Jan
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

# prints a string which includes days
puts "Here are the days: #{days}"
# prints a string which includes months
puts "Here are the months: #{months}"

# prints an indented paragraph of the values within the array
puts %q{
  There's something going on here.
  With this weird quote
  We'll be able to type as much as we like.
  Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
}
