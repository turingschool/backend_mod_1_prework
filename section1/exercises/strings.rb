What discordant vespers do the tinkers goods chime
through the long twilight and over the brindled forest road?
Him stooped and hounded through the last windy recrements of day
like those old exiles who divorced of corporeality and
enjoined ingress of heaven or hell
wander forever the middle warren
spoorless increate and anathema.
