# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
 name = "dee"
 puts name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
puts house_elf
# YOUR CODE HERE

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
string = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
puts string


# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
students = students + 2

puts students

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
# YOUR CODE HERE
 students = students - 2
 puts students


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "dee"
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = 2

puts "my name is #{first_name} Am I hungry? #{is_hungry}, I have #{number_of_pets} pets."

# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?

# I decidedf to myake first_name a string asking for a name.
# is_hungry is a boolean because how its structured
# number_of_pets is an integer


# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Jarvis"
is_hungry = false
number_of_pets = 0

puts "my name is #{first_name} Am I hungry? #{is_hungry}, I have #{number_of_pets} pets."

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

puts " We have a total of #{healthy_snacks} healthy snacks and #{junk_food_snacks} junk food snacks which equal #{healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks} snacks."

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?
