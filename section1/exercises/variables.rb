# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
p house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
warning = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
p warning

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
new_students = students + 2
p new_students

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
departing_students = students -2
p departing_students


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Eric"

is_hungry = "for tacos"

number_of_pets = 2

# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?

# Explain.
# For first name, I chose my own first name and made it a string as names are rarely numbers.
# Same logic for is_hungry. I want tacos, so I chose a string. Trying to keep the eventual
# puts within the flow of a normal, human conversation
# number_of_pets, the data type was a interger becuase I don't have a decimal value of dogs. Just 2.

# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.

first_name = "Roberto"

is_hungry = "loves"

number_of_pets = 4

puts "#{first_name} #{is_hungry} his #{number_of_pets} dogs with his whole heart."

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

puts "The total number of snacks: #{healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks}"

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?
