# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
p house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
warning = 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts'
p warning
# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
add = students + 2
p add

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22 - 2
p students


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Erin"
p first_name
is_hungry = true
p is_hungry
number_of_pets = 3
p number_of_pets
# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
#for first name I choose to use a string becuase this was just going to be a line of characters and i felt that matched correctly
#for is hungry i noticed it was phrased as a true/false question which is normal for a boolean
#I noticed number of pets could be a interger or a float since it needed to be a number- i picked a float becuase you cant have .5 of a pet lol
# Explain.


# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Aaron"
p first_name
is_hungry = false
p is_hungry
number_of_pets = 4
p number_of_pets

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;
total_snacks = healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks
p total_snacks

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?
  # yes, yay!
