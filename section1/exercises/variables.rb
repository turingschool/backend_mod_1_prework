# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
my_name = "Erika Kischuk"
p my_name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
free_elf = "Dobby"
p free_elf
# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
warning_for_harry = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
p warning_for_harry

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
p students + 2

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
p students - 2


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
first_name = "Erika"
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = 3
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
p first_name
p is_hungry
p number_of_pets

# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
# Explain.
# I used a string for first_name because it is a collection of characters. I used a boolean for is_hungry because the variable name is framed as a question
# I used an integer for number_of_pets, because you cannot have a partial pet and it was requesting a number so it had to be an integer.

# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Brent"
is_hungry = false
number_of_pets = 1
p first_name
p is_hungry
p number_of_pets

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;
total_snacks = healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks
p total_snacks

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?
