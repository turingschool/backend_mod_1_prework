# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Dane Brophy"
puts "Hi there, I'm #{name}!"

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
puts "Woah, #{house_elf} is a free elf!"

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
foreboding_warning = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
puts "Remember that time in that one book when that one guy said #{foreboding_warning}?"

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
