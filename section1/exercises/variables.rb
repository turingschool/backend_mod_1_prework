# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
p house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
announcement = "Harry potter must not return to hogwarts"
p announcement

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
students = students + 2
p students

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = students - 2
p students


# YOU DO:
first_name = "Mitch"
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = 2
p first_name, is_hungry, number_of_pets

# IN WORDS:
# EXPLAIN
first_name is a string, my name.
is_hungry is a boolean data type (true/false).
number_of_pets was definitely going to be an integer (whole number)

# YOU DO:
first_name = "Mike"
is_hungry = false
number_of_pets = 1
p first_name, is_hungry, number_of_pets


# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

healthy_snacks = 6
junk_food_snacks = 8
p healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?
