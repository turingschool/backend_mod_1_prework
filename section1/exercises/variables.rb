# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
p house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
statement = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts"
p statement

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
students = students + 2
p students

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
students = students - 2
p students


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Carlos"
is_hungry = false
number_of_pets = 4
p "Is #{first_name} hungry?"
p "#{is_hungry}"
p "All #{number_of_pets} of his pets are though."

# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
# I decided to use string, boolean and integers.
# Explain.
# first_name typically involves just a name which results in using a string. is_hungry only has two outcomes, a y/n which is boolean. Number of pets can only result in using integers.

# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Francis"
is_hungry = "true"
number_of_pets = 7
p "I saw #{first_name} today, as for if he was hungry...it's #{is_hungry}, based on if he ate last night. He did get three more dogs which increases his pets to #{number_of_pets}!!"

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;
p healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?
  #yes!
