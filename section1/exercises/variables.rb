# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
puts house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
dobbys_warning = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
puts dobbys_warning

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
students = students + 2
p students

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = students - 2
p students


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Andrew"
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = 9
puts first_name
puts is_hungry
puts number_of_pets
# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
# The name of a person consists of readable characters, so String is the most
# logical data type for first_name. is_hungry seems to indicate a yes or no
# question, so Boolean is the most logical data type. number_of_pets indicates
# a mathematical value, and since pets are normally accounted for in whole
# numbers, integer is the most logical data type.

# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Otis"
is_hungry = false
number_of_pets = 8
puts first_name
puts is_hungry
puts number_of_pets

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;
puts "The total number of snacks is #{healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks}"

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?
