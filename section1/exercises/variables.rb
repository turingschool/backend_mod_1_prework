# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
puts house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
dobby_quote = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
puts dobby_quote

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
puts students += 2

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
puts students -= 2


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Jamie"
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = 0
puts first_name
puts is_hungry
puts number_of_pets

# IN WORDS: For the variable name, the data needed to be a name so I set it to a string, assigning it my first name, Jamie. For is_hungry, the variable seemed like a true/false question, so I used a boolean and put true. For number_of_pets, the data needed to be an integer (not a float, since you can't have a fraction of a pet), and I assigned it the value 0.
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
# Explain. See above


# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Dumbledore"
is_hungry = false
number_of_pets = 1
puts first_name
puts is_hungry
puts number_of_pets


# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;
puts healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks


#-------------------
# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect? Yes, everything ran without any errors and gave me the output I expected.
