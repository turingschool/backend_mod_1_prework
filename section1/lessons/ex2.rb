# Study Drills

# 1) Find out if you were right about what the # character does and
# make sure you know what it's called (octothorpe or pound character).

# -- Yes, I was right about the pound sign.  I know exactly what it does and is called.

# 2) Take your ex2.rb file and review each line going backward. Start at
# the last line, and check each word in reverse against what you should have typed.

# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by ruby.

puts "I could have coded like this." # Fixed grammar, changed code to coded.

# # You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# puts "This won't run.", so it should be...

puts "This won't run."

# 3) Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.

# No

# 4) Read what you typed above out loud, including saying each character
# by its name. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.

# -- After goiing through it twice according to 2) and 3), I did not see anymore
# mistakes.
