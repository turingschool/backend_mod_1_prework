# Study Drills

# 1) Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what
# the line does.

# -- See above

# 2) Remember in Exercise 0 when you started irb? Start irb this way again and,
# using the math operators, use Ruby as a calculator.

# -- Done

# 3) Find something you need to calculate and write a new .rb file that does it.

# -- Done

# 4) Rewrite ex3.rb to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate.
# 20.0 is floating point.

# -- See above
