## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
- The article on "super learners" resonated with me quite a lot, as these are skills I have stumbled across on my own journey to become a better learner. I already read daily, have an open-ended goal to continue learning, recognized a fixed mindset was present in my youth and cultivated a growth mindset to foster my own development, teach my friends often what new things I have learned, and meditate & read & consume nootropic foods and supplements.
- The one thing I could do more of is provide myself with more frequent breaks.
- If I would add anything to this list, I would consider adding the determination of a strong motivator for becoming a better learner. My personal motivation is to become the best version of myself while inspiring others to do the same.

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
```rb
print "Hello World!"
```
OR
```rb
puts "Hello World!"
```

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
- The "#" character is referred to as a hash, octothorpe, or pound character.

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
- An integer is a whole number, while a float uses decimals for more numeric precision.

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
```rb
animal = "zebra"
```

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
```rb
puts animal
```

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
- Interpolation is the process of passing defined variables into strings to act as elements of the string.
example:
```rb
"The #{animal} is an interesting animal!"
```

8. What method is used to get input from a user?
- The `gets.chomp` method prompts a use for input, which is then used as the value of a variable.

9. Name and describe two common string methods:
- String concatenation is a common method used to join two or more strings together. This can be accomplished with a "+" character or using an "append" method.
- `.upcase` is a common method that converts string characters into uppercase.
