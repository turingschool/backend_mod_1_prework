## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
 + The SuperLearner Article is something I am a little familiar with. I definitely agree that learning is a process or a journey and that it never stops. I can see how these 6 points are effective in learning and really retaining the information.
 + Some of the points I already do are 2, 3, and 4. I am the type of person that always wants to be learning new things or taking in new information. I believe there is always room for growth and  learning can help you become a better person. When I learn something new I get excited and I love to share it.
 + I want to read more and take care of myself better. I find that I listen to a lot of podcasts or audiobooks, but I want to take more time to sit down and read a physical book. I also have the habit of sitting down and spending hours focusing on something instead of taking breaks. I also sometimes fill my "breaks" with different information. I want to focus on taking time to sit in silence so I can reflect on new things I am learning.
 + I think another habit that could be added to the list is being open minded, which is similar to having a growth mindset. Having an open mind can help you discover new things even about topics you may have an expertise in. If you are set or not open to new ideas on how things are done, you may miss out on learning something great.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
 + First you would need to open an irb session by  typing irb in terminal.
 + Then you would type: **puts "Hello World!"** to print the string.
 + You can also use prints instead of puts.

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
 + Comments are indicated by the octothorpe or pound character #.

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
 + An integer is a whole number and a float is a decimal number.
 + For example 4 is an integer and 4.0 is a float.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

 animal = "zebra"

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

 puts = animal

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

 + Interpolation is adding a variable (or multiple variables) in the middle of a string.
 + puts = "This #{animal} has stripes."

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

 + gets is a method that asks for input from a user.
 + Adding .chomp will remove the newline character so the result is on a single line.

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

 + One common string method is .length which returns the number of characters in a string.
 + Ex: "Flowers".length => 7
+ Another common string method is .sub which replaces a single occurance in your code. .gsub replaces all occurances in the code.
+ Ex: note = "Stope and smell the flowers!"
  note.sub("smell","enjoy")
  => "Stope and enjoy the flowers!"
