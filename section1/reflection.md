## Section 1 Reflection

#### 1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
* I agreed with it. I currently read daily, see learning as a journey rather than a destination, and am open minded to alternative viewpoints. I could take better care of my brain by eating better foods and eliminating alcohol. One thing that I'd add, is just to challenge yourself, no matter the task. If you do that, you will learn more.

#### 2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
* irb
* puts '"Hello World!"'

#### 3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
* the octothorpe symbol. <#>

#### 4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
* an integer is a whole number, a float is a decimal number

#### 5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
* animal = '"zebra"'

#### 6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
* puts animal

#### 7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
* Interpolation is where we stick data into the middle of a string.
* puts "My favorite striped mammal is a #{animal}, they are pretty cool"

#### 8. What method is used to get input from a user?
* gets (or gets.chomp)

#### 9. Name and describe two common string methods:
* .length tells you how many characters are in a string
* .split breaks a string into parts, turning a string into an array
