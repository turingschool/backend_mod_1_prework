## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I find that I actually do a lot of this already, in my opinion. The first several points the article makes I found that I already do, but at the end when they talk about taking breaks is where my greatest opportunity for improvement is. I tend to work really hard until the work is done, and I feel this is very inefficient just like the article says. I'm definitely going to try to be better about that in the future.
