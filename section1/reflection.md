## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

The article is a great insight on how to be disciplined in learning something completely new.

How it resonates with me :: I've been in different fields and started from scratch, so I can understand how important it is to start with a disciplined state of mind and to learn smartly

What I already do :: I love reading. Especially when I get into a new field. I like to read articles in TechCrunch and try to associate it with B.E. as much as possible. When details of a tech company are being discussed, I look for keywords and how they are solving problems that users face.

You can get the length of a string using .length, which is super useful when you want to check the string length before putting it into a database. And you can also change the case of a string by using string.downcase or string.upcase
