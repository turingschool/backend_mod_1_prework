## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

*I've always thought that learning was a process, like building a house. Each new topic learn helps build the next level, so it's important to think of each step as one forward. I like using a house metaphor because it lets you have an end goal, but you can always build another one or help someone else build theirs.*
*My biggest takeaway is taking breaks to allow the information to absorb. I've always been a work until I can't person, and I think this idea of slowing down to process the information will help me retain it more. Diet was an eye opener too, but something I hope to take control of as I start this new journey.*

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
 `puts "Hello World!"`

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
 *The pound character or octothorpe indicates comments in a ruby file.*

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
*An integer is whole number and a float can contain decimal places.*

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

```ruby
animal = "zebra"
```

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

```ruby
puts animal
```

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
*Interpolation is when you insert a variable into a string.*

`print "What animal is black & white striped? A #{animal}."`

1. What method is used to get input from a user?
*`gets.chomp` is used to get input. You can also you gets, but it will create a new line character after the input.*

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

*`.split` will split a sting at each " " and return the results as an array.*

*`.gsub` allows us to substitute in a new word or value within a string.*
