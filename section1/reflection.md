## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
  1. I tend to read a lot as well, however it's not exactly reading that can help me with my career. If I can shift some of that into career based reading I can get ahead. I'm sure there's plenty of good websites out there to keep up on things, and I can possibly even network with professionals on social media to find good discourse.
  2. As a lifelong student (I used tuition assistance the entire time I was in the Air Force, and was in college before that), I tend to already view learning as a process. It never ends, and if you've stopped learning then you aren't challenging yourself enough.
  3. I've taken a lot of courses in the past that speak about growth mindset and keeping an eye out for opportunity. This is definitely something I've worked on but something that can always be improved. I can identify failings and challenges as things to be overcome, not things that have dragged me down.
  4. In the Air Force I was an instructor, evaluator, and subject matter expert. I may be a bit of an introvert, but I can teach what I know and definitely have done it in the past to my unit's benefit.
  5. My diet could definitely be worked on, but I like to keep my mind sharp in other ways. I'm a chess player, and while I'm not all that great, I do enjoy spending time playing, then evaluating my games to improve over time.
  6. I'm very guilty of just working through breaks and not giving myself any downtime. It leads to quick burnout. However, I've recently installed a pomodoro assistant via Chrome extensions, and will be giving that a go for my own sanity. I really don't want to burn myself out on this program.

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?\
`puts '"Hello World!"'`

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?\
`#`

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
* Integers are positive and negative whole numbers, as well as zero.
* Floats are numbers that have values on both sides of a decimal point: -52.4, 0.68, 101.0, etc.

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`\
`animal = "zebra"`

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?\
`p animal`

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.\
`p "One of the animals at the zoo is the #{animal}!"`

8. What method is used to get input from a user?\
`gets.chomp`

9. Name and describe two common string methods:\
`string.length` checks for the length of the string and returns it as an integer.\
`string.capitalize` capitalizes the first letter of the string.
