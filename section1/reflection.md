## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?  

   There are a couple super learner habits that I already have today. I do my best to take care of my brain with a healthy diet and share knowledge as often as I can. I want to work on adopting a growth mindset over the coming months. Being in the same career for the last few years has put me in auto pilot mode. It is going to take effort and time to shift to the growth mindset. Also, the practice of taking breaks is going to be a change. My default is to power through and don't do a good job of taking any breaks today.

```

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.  

   Interpolation is the use of variables inside a string  

```ruby
puts "We got to see a #{animal} while at the zoo."
```

1. What method is used to get input from a user?  

   You would use the get.chomp method to get an input from a user.

1. Name and describe two common string methods:  

   .gsub functions like find & replace all in a word processor. It will replace all occurances of one string with a new one.
   .length will tell you how many characters are in a string
