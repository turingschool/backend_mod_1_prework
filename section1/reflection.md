## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?  
I already read a good deal; however I need to work on reading a more diverse collection of books. I primarily read books for pleasure. I already imagine that I am teaching other people things that I have learned but I will put more effort in this and actual teach a real person as opposed to imagining how I would teach someone if I needed to. I absolutely need to work on taking more breaks. I enjoy the pomodoro technique, I plan to employ it outside of class. The podcast flow state is a nice way to organize your pom breaks with music.
