## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

   * I enjoyed reading the SuperLearner article. The parts that stood out to me most are that you need to find joy in the journey of learning and that you retain 90% of what you learn if you use it or share it right away. My wife and I always share what we're doing and by the end of this, she might be able to code haha! One takeaway that I want to do more of is taking short breaks often. I tend to get into something and lose track of time. I got the marinara timer and am going to use it often.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

   * `p "Hello World!"`

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

   * #

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

   * Integers are whole numbers and floats contain a decimal.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

   * `animal = "zebra"`

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

   * `print animal`

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

   * Interpolation allows you to substitute variables into strings. Example: `print "The #{animal} needs a bath today."` would print: The zebra needs a bath today.  

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

   * `gets`

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

   * `.length` would tell you how many characters and spaces are in the string.
   * `.split` would split a string into an array of individual strings of each word or number.
