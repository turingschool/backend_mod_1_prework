## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

Great article! I would say that one thing I naturally do well is viewing learning as a process and maintaining a sustained curiosity. There's always something to learn and some way one can improve, so I strive to keep growing in any way that I can. One thing I could definitely work on is my ability to teach others the knowledge I've acquired. I've never been great at teaching but it's something I would like to be better at doing. One thing that could be added to the list might be keeping a regular exercise routine and working on time management skills. I've always been pretty good at getting things done under pressure but I would like to be better at managing my time so I don't put extra stress on myself or others.

Interpolation returns a string with a #{} which uses a defined variable.

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

gets.chomp

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
