## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

All the habits sounded pretty intuitive to me, except the last one (short breaks early and often). I always worry about my short attention span and lack of stamina, and my strategy has always been, "work as much and as long as possible with least amount of break while I can concentrate." It's also hard to stop for a break while things are going well. But maybe it's a good strategy to stop while I am ahead without having micro-burnout every few hours and be useless for the rest of the day.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

$print "Hello World"

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
#

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
integer doesn't have decimal point. float does

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
animal = "zebra"

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
p zebra

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.  interpolation is a way of printing by using one main pair of quotes and #{} within the quotes to insert whatever.

  p "An animal my son hasn't seen in person: #{animal}"

1. What method is used to get input from a user?
gets.chomp?    it seems that method is what comes after the period, so maybe just .chomp? But then I thought chomp was the method that chop off the new line. So I am not sure.

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
.split - splits a string into substrings along space.
.sub("x","y") - find in the string the first occurrence of "x" and replace it iwth "y"
