## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I found the superlearner article very interesting. I found it most interesting that the author found reading so important. I already do a good bit of reading on my own. Most of the reading I do is  for enjoyment, but this article really pointed out how reading is crucial for all fields, not just literature or the arts. I want to start reading more from books that are related to the field of software development. As I said before, I already read a lot, but it may be interesting to dive in to the literature related to my future career path. I cannot think of many other habits that I would like added to the list.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

`prints "Hello World!"`

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

The octothorpe or the pounds sign is used to turn a line into a comment. This can also be put at the beginning of a line to deactivate that line of code.

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

Integers are whole numbers and floats are numbers with decimals. If possible, we should try to use integers because they are easier for both us, and our computers to use.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

`animal = "zebra"`

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

`print animal`

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

`print "Andrew said his favorite animal is a #{animal}."`

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

`gets.chomp`

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

`.length` returns the number of characters in the string
`.split` returns an array with all of the separate words of the string. The method knows to break the string into individual array items at every space.
