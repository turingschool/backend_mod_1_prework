## Section 1 Reflection

How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

* The article mentioned that learning never has an endpoint really stuck out to me. As a former teacher, that is absolutely true, and even to this day, find that I am needing to keep adapting to my surroundings in order to move forward and progress. I honestly need to start giving my brain time to rest and recover! I have always been one to push through and get the job done, but as I'm getting older, it's just not always necessary nor is it healthy to keep doing that to my body. As for anything else that I might possibly add, I don't think that there's anything that I would. It's a short and sweet list, and there's beauty in that. Sometimes keeping it simple is the best approach.

How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

* `puts "Hello World!"`

What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

* `#`

Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

* An integer is essentially a whole number with no decimal place value, whereas a float is an integer with decimal place values.

In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

* ```animal = "zebra"```

How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

* ```puts zebra```

What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

* Interpolation is the insertion of a different nature into something else.

```
animal = "zebra"
number_of_lakes = 2

puts "I saw a #{animal} once swim through #{number_of_lakes} lakes before."
```

What method is used to get input from a user?

* `variable = gets.chomp`

Name and describe two common string methods:

* string.length: Find the length of the string
* string.sub("old word", "new word"): Replace a single occurrence of a string with a new string
