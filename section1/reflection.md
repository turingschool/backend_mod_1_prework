## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

  - I feel like I do #'s 1, 2, and 3 well.
  - I will need to push myself more to do #4 and teach others to help me retain more of what I learn
  - #5:  I need to take care of my brain better.  This relates to consumption and exercise.  Be aware of how often I do each and take note of how I'm feeling and adjust.
  - #6:  I feel like I am good about taking breaks.  However, this is something to take note of throughout the program and reflect on how I am feeling about it.

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

  Two common string methods are `.length` and `.split`.

  `.length` tells you how many characters (including spaces) are in the string.
  `.split` cuts the string wherever it encounters a space character and returns an array.
