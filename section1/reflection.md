## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
The big theme I saw from the superlearner article is that it's important to realize learning is a active process, but also that people will always have something new to learn, even on subjects they may already be well versed in. Superlearners are people who are always open to trying something new and are always trying to improve their learning process and their knowledge. I think i am good at having a growth mindset and being okay with failing in order to keep learning. I am trying to improve my undestanding of things, and how I learn things. I need to start taking more short breaks, for me it is difficult to sometimes know when to take a break and feel okay with it. I would also say it is sometimes difficult for me to feel like I can get "enough" done by working in short chunks. One thing I think should be included is getting enough sleep. Getting enough high quality sleep is important for optimal brain function, so i think it should also be included for super learners.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
An Interger is a whole number without a decimal point it can be positive, negative, or zero.
A Float is a number with a decimal point, there needs to be a number on both sides of the decimal point. These can be positive or negative number.
1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
animal = "zebra"
1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
p animal
1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
P "A #{animal} has black and white stripes"
1. What method is used to get input from a user?
it would be gets.chomp . From what i was able to see with the "learn ruby the hard way" first we woudl print the question then set it up as the variable = gets.chomp
1. Name and describe two common string methods:
.length is used to figure out how many characters including spaces are in the string.
.split is used to break strings into parts- it will cut the string whenever it runs into a space so it seems to typically be used when wanting to break a string into individual pieces i.e. a whole sentence that is a string broken into words.
