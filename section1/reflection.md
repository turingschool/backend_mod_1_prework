## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it? The article was a good reminder for me that learning is a skill and that it requires practice and can be improved with certain techniques. I'm a huge reader, so that's something that I'm already doing on a daily basis. I don't frequently teach or share with others what I know, so that's something I can definitely work on and try to practice more frequently.
