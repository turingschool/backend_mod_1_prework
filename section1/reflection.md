## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I found the Six Habits of Super Learners article to be really fascinating, so much so that I shared it with my family and a few friends. I was proud to learn that I already do half of the 6 habits, but even so, a reminder of how important and helpful they are to the learning process is both needed and appreciated. I read a lot, believe in and practice a growth mindset, and eat foods to help take care of my brain. It is just within the past year that I have started to view learning as a process and not a destination, and it has truly shifted my paradigm of what it means to learn and try new things. Growing up, I felt as if learning was a skill that people either had for certain subjects, or didn't. I now know that this is not the case, and that learning looks different for everybody. I would love to start taking more breaks, because I am very used to powering through my work for hours upon hours. I would also like to practice teaching the concepts I'm learning even just out loud to myself. I used this technique in high school with a big white board in my room and I really felt as if I was benefitting from it. One thing I would add to the list is to seek emotional and mental support when feeling low and unmotivated. I find that unity and community really lift your spirits and can improve your state of mind.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

`animal = "zebra"`

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

`p animal`

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

Interpolation is creating a string that contains place-holding variables using the #{} (hash function) which are then replaced by the value of that variable when called for a printed result of the string.

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

`gets.chomp`

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

`str.count()` yields how many times a specific character appears in a string.
`(str).strip` removes any extra white space in a string.
