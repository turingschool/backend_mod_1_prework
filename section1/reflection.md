## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I really enjoy the sentiment of learning as processual rather than being end oriented.  
This tends to prevent a 'shutting off' of learning after a benchmark of understanding.  
The thing that I need to do more of is eat better, gotta get them nutrients!

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
```ruby
puts "Hello world"
```
1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

#

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

Integers do not have a decimal place, floats have at least one.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
```ruby
animal = "zebra"
```
1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
```ruby
puts animal
```
1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

Interpolation is slapping data inside of a string.
```ruby
puts "have you ever seen a #{animal}?"
```
1. What method is used to get input from a user?
```ruby
gets.chomp
```
1. Name and describe two common string methods:

string_name[0..3] :lists the characters in those positions.
array_name = string_name.split :gives an array and split at space (unless otherwise specified).
