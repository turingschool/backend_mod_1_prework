## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
The article resonated with me by bringing to attention read a lot.  I personally do
rule 2 because it makes clear that you suck.  Sucking is a part of any learning process
but to keep fighting is the only way.  I want to start reading more as rule 1 states
because I have not read since high school.  This list needs a section on grit and
how struggle is the only way to freedom from suckage.

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
##Interpolation
Use of a variable in a string with `#{}` anything within the curly braces will be exported to the console.
##Concatenation
Use of a variable to combine a string from left to right.
Ex
```a = "dog" b = "bites" c = "cat"
puts a + b + c
```
