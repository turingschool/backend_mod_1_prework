## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
- The superlearner article helped remind myself that our brains are muscles.  This means that just like physical exercise cannot be done all day long the same goes for learning.  We need to regularly take breaks to allow ourselves to grow and recover.  Also a lot of our success comes from how we treat out muscles outside of our activities.  This suggests eating well, sleeping well, and remaining hydrated.  My final thought is learning never ends.  We must prepare ourselves to be open to learning throughout our entire lives and a lot of that success comes from how you treat yourself each and everyday.
