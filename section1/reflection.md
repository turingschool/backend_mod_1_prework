## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

-I enjoyed reading the article. A lot of the points made sense to me and its something I could start incorporating into my studies. One thing I need to do is start taking more breaks and give myself time to process new information, as I tend to just keep going and that hurts retention. I do enjoy teaching people things that I have recently learned as well, it proves to people that you have a strong understanding of a certain topic; if you can explain something to a person unfamiliar on the topic, you should have a good grasp on what is being taught.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

-If I just wanted to have "Hello World!" show up on my screen I would use p, puts, or print followed by "Hello World!".

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
# this character. I call it the "pound sign"

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

-Integer is a whole number, can also be negative or 0.
-Float is a decimal number, can also be negative.


1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

animal = "zebra"

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

p animal

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

p "My favorite animal is the #{animal}."

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

-In ex11.rb we had to use "gets.chomp" for user to enter custom information. EX: print "Where were you born?" Then put "birthplace = gets.chomp".

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

-We used split a couple of times working through section 1. We also specified how we wanted to separate information like using a comma. ",".

-Another one was using .length. This just counts the number of characters in a string. EX: animal = "dog"  then typing in dog.length
