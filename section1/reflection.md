## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I thought the line, "Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body", was really clever and made a lot of sense. What a great way to look at it.

Also, that learners retain 90% of what they learn when they explain the concept to someone else or use it immediately. That teaching others what you know is one of the most effective ways to learn. I've really enjoyed helping fellow classmates through material that I've already completed, for a few reasons. First being that it certainly DOES reinforce what I've already learned, but also that it feels good to help.

I think if I were to add something to this list, it would be that good sleep is crucial. Keeping a consistent circadian rythm helps your brain retain the lessons of the day, and will help you feel refreshed when you start a new day.
