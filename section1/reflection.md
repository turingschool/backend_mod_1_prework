## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do?
   Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

   The Super Learner article offers some excellent advice and inspired me to reevaluate my attitudes
   and methods around learning. The number 2 habit, view learning as a process, is a lesson that
   I eventually understood later in life before enrolling with Turning. It has been my experience that
   viewing learning as a journey and not a destination, has allowed me to overcome the frustrations that can stem from the perceived struggle to reach the imagined destination. When I switched my mindset to value the process of learning,
   demoralizing frustration was greatly diminished and the negative connotations of the struggle were
   replaced with the fulfillment of progressively building knowledge.
   There is not anything that I would add to this list but I have added something from this list to my
   personal workflow. I have been working in 50/10 work/break sessions during this section and feel I
   have benefited from giving my mind the rest.

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

    We implemented two methods of printing to the terminal in this section.
    <p>, <p "Hello World">
    <puts>, <puts "Hello World">
    Both will print the string value but <p> will print the quotation marks while
    <puts> will omit them.

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

    The <#> symbol, is used to indicate comments in a ruby file. Add it before the
    line you do not want ruby to execute. Each line needs its own <#>.
    In Zed A. Shaw's, Learn Ruby the Hard Way, he refers to <#> as an octothorpe.

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

    An integer is a whole number that is positive, negative or 0, while a float is
    a positive or negative number with a decimal point.

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
    animal = "zebra"

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

    p animal

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

    Interpolation, or "string interpolation", is a method used in Ruby to embed variable data in a string.
    p "The Lion is hunting a #{animal}."

8. What method is used to get input from a user?

    gets

9. Name and describe two common string methods:

    .length
    Returns, as an integer, the number of characters in a string including the spaces in the count.

    .chomp
    Removes the last character in a string only if it is a newline <\n> or a carriage return <\r>.
