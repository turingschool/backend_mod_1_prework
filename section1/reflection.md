## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

- The article really made me evaluate how I've treated learning in the past and how I've come to view it in my late 20s. When I was in grade school, and even in college, learning was just something I had to do to get to the next step. It was how I was going to graduate so I could get to the "real world". It's been years since I've taken a college course and I still have never stopped learning.
Now, I view learning as a process and I get excited about learning a new skill. For example, I'm not going to learn everything I need to know to be a developer at Turing. Learning takes time and I know that even after this course I'm going to have to continue to read and research what I need to know to stay up to date, expand my knowledge, and learn new languages. Learning never ends and it excites me that I will continue to learn new things every day of my life as a developer.
- I also have the "growth mindset" that is mentioned in the article. When I stumble upon something I've never seen before, but I find out I like it, I dive deep into it. I recently decided that I needed to buy a new keyboard. When I went to go look up "best keyboard for programmers and gamers" I found a whole world of keyboards that I've been researching ever since. Having that growth mindset allows me to find new interests and expand upon them.

- Something I want to do more of is to read more and take short breaks often. I've always felt that I don't read enough. Even reading fiction can help expand the mind and create new ideas. Something I want to focus on is reading more about different areas of my life that interest me but especially focus on my new skills that I'm learning to be a developer. Like I said before, I am always going to be learning. Reading is one of the best ways to learn new information before putting it into practice. I usually prefer video demonstrations but a combination would be super powerful.
Taking breaks more often is something that I've never focused on before. I always just powered through whatever I'm working on. The "pom breaks" really help to keep me focused and I want to continue using this new technique. I have my phone set to DND, I play some lo-fi hip hop, and I know that I have 25 minutes to get a chunk of work done. It's helped me keep focused since I started this assignment and I plan to continue utilizing it.

- Something I would add to the list is that a super learner makes mistakes. They make the mistakes but then they grow from those mistakes and don't give up. Making mistakes can be a wonderful process. Just like how getting lost in a new city can be scary but it can also be absolutely wonderful. Learners who make mistakes, work through them, and continue on will have a better experience than those who get stuck and give up.

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
- `puts "Hello World!"`

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
- the pound sign "#".

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
- An integer is a whole number that can be positive, negative, or zero.
A float has a decimal and can be positive or negative.  

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
- `animal = "zebra"`

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
- `puts animal`

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
- Interpolation is a place holder in a string that is later replaced by real values from a variable later on.
`puts "The #{animal} in Madagascar is voiced by Chris Rock."`

8. What method is used to get input from a user?
- `gets.chomp`

9. Name and describe two common string methods:
- `.length` tells you how many characters are in a string including spaces.
- `.split` splits a string into an array where there is a space between words.
  `.split` can also be used to split using a character other than a space by typing in something like `.split","` to get it to split on the "," instead of a space.
