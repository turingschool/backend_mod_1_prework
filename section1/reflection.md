## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
The SuperLearner article is good because it brings up a lot of points that we need to pay attention to. I need to remember that learning is a process and I will not get everything right away and teaching is a great way to solidify your knowledge. I'm already trying to teach my roommate what I've learned. Also, I just purchased "a Mind for Numbers" and I want to make sure that I'm doing at lease a litle ready each day.
