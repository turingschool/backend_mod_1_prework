## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
   - There are a lot of points of this article that resonated with me.  
       - **Learning is a process** => you can't know everything over night--it's a journey.  And you have to keep practicing/recalling it.  Otherwise, you will forget.
       - **Teach others what they know** => I believe that if you can teach others something, it will help you retain the knowledge.  Or even try to talk about it with your spouse of friend, even though they will not understand, but it will force you to think about the subject and retain it more.
   - I think the points I'd like to start implementing are:
       - **Take care of the brain** => when I'm busy, I forget to eat.  Or when I eat, the foods are not brain foods.  I need to be mindful and do better.
       - **Take short breaks, early and often** => this is something I constantly struggle with as I like getting things done ASAP.  As a result, I'd sit and do work for hours before realizing I should take a break. Again, I need to be more mindful of it.
