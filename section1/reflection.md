## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

* Out of the six habits of super learners, the new things I would like to incorporate are taking breaks (using the pomodoro method) and eating brain foods. I already read and teach others but I would like to seriously improve those habits and increase their frequency.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

* `p "Hello World!"`

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

* An octothorpe, also known as a hash or pound sign `#`

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

* An integer is a whole number and a float has a decimal. Ex: 12 is an integer and 12.459 is a float.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

* `animal = "zebra"`

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

* `p animal`

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

* `p "My favorite animal at the zoo is a #{animal}"`

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

* `gets.chomp`

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

* We learned about `.length`, `.split`, `.sub`, and `.gsub`. But I just read about the methods `.join` and `.strip`, so to put my super learner tips to practice, I'll teach those beyond the binary about them.
 * `.join` kind of does the opposite of `.split`, it takes and array and combines them into a string.
 * `.strip` removes extra spaces in a string, or trims white space.
