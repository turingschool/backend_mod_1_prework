## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
Discipline really resonated with me. It talked to me about refining skills which brings me back to my sports career and practicing hour after hour. I have a couple things I already do such as taking care of your brain along with your body as well as a growing mindset. The taking care of the body and mind I workout all the time and I try to eat healthy so that my body can replenish all the calories lost as well build muscle. Along with the mindset in which learning never stops the world never stops. With people discovering new ideas every day people can't afford to not stop learning new techniques that may lead to newer better abilities or maybe it makes the job easier with new advances. One thing I wanna do more is read more. Reading is healthy for the brain and you learn a great deal.I said it earlier but taking care of your body is just as important as taking care of your mind. They didn't say the body in the reading but you only have one body so take care of it now and you'll feel good going forward. Not saying being a body builder or a cross fit expert but take a walk or lift a little weights to keep you right.

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
- interpolation allows you to substitute the results or variables that you have assigned into a string.

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
- Two common string methods would be interpolation which is allowing you to substitute assigned avariable in a string. Another one would be string length. Adding .length you can figure out how long your string is.
