## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
  * The SuperLearner Article has some great points—some things I do already and other areas could use improvement. I do remember things better when I teach someone else. I didn't know it helped with 90% recall so I could do more teaching to learn and remember. I usually eat fairly healthy, but now I want to eat more brain food — blueberries, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy unsaturated fats. I would like to apply the Pomodoro technique while studying. I take some breaks but not as often as I could. I want to focus more on the process versus the end goal in order to understand how I did it instead of just completing a task and not understanding how. I want to read more since it's like exercise for the brain.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
  * Type in `irb`
  * Then run `p "Hello World!"`

2. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
  * A hash or octothrope to the left of a comment. # This is a comment.

3. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
  * An integer is a whole number.
  * A float is a number with a decimal point.

4. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
  * `animal = "zebra"`

5. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
  * `p animal`

6. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
  * Interpolation is where you reference variables within a string.
  * `p "Charlie saw a #{animal} on a safari."`

7. What method is used to get input from a user?
  * `gets.chomp`

8. Name and describe two common string methods:
  * `.length` counts the number of characters (including spaces) in a string
    * i.e. `irb` > `greeting = “Hello Everyone!”` > `greeting.length` => 15
  * `.split` with take a string, put each word into a strings in an array, cutting the string at spaces.
    * i.e. `irb` > `sentence = "This is my sample sentence.”` > `sentence.split` => `["This", "is", "my", "sample", “sentence."]`
