## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
  This article definitely had me think about some of my learning habits in grad school and how I can improve upon them now. I think the hardest one for me will be taking breaks early and often. I tend to get immersed in my work and succumb to the black hole of learning and then I emerge and need a 2 hour break. I don't think this is the most sustainable habit, and finding more breaks within the day will definitely help me breathe and stay on top of assignments.

  The other thing that hit me was about reading. Growing up I used to love to read, and would spend hours and weekends immersed in books. I think I still like to, I just don't find the time to do it anymore. Unless I'm on a true nothing else is happening vacation I tend to not feel like I have time for reading. I had to read so many essays, books, articles, and just general research in grad school that my desire to read began to dwindle a bit. It's one thing I would love to find time and my love for again. Here's to hoping reading and I can meet up soon.

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
  Interpolation combines a string with a code expression such as a variable or an equation.
  puts "This #{animal} is wild."

1. What method is used to get input from a user?
  gets.chomp

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
  string.length
  - grabs how many characters are in the string (includes spaces).
  string.split()
  - splits a string into an array based on the argument you input with parenthesis, no parenthesis immediately splits strings when it finds a space.
