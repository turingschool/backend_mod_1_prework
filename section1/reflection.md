## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
- Spacing out learning to help memorize new information more efficiently resonated with me.
- I currently practice good eating habits and take care of my brain health. I also have a growth mindset and try to teach others what I know when the opportunity arises.
- I would love to become a better super learner by reading more and by taking short breaks, early and often. I've been implementing pom breaks into my learning but this definitely still needs some practice.
- I think we could also add in that reviewing the lesson beforehand is very useful when learning new material.

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
- Interpolation is the process of evaluating a string literal containing one or more placeholders, yielding a result in which the placeholders are replaced with their corresponding values.
- `p "My favorite African animal is the #{animal}"`

1. What method is used to get input from a user?
- `gets`

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
- `.length` is a method that tells you how many characters (including spaces) are in a string.
- `.gsub` is a method that is short for global substitute and it replaces all occurances in a string.
