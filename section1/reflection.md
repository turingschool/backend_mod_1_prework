## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

* *I felt that I do already have a growth mindset. I am happiest in an environment where I am learning new things. I believe there is a lot that I can take and implement from this article. Mainly taking short breaks, taking care of my brain, and reading a lot. Those are all habits I could be more conscious of and building those habits earlier will help me the most in the long run.*

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

```ruby
puts "Hello World"
```

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

* *The "#" or as it is called the octothrope.*

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

* *An integer is a number with no decimal. A float is a number that does have a decimal point.ÃŸ*

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

```ruby
animal = "zebra"
```

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

```ruby
puts zebra
```

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
string interpolation is used to stick data into the middle of a string.

```ruby
puts "#{animal}'s are both black and white.'"
```

1. What method is used to get input from a user?
* *gets allows for user input. Where gets.chomp allows for user input with no additional line after*
1. Name and describe two common string methods:
* *.sub is like a find and replace tool. It will find the specified word and replace it with a new specified word.*
* *.split will split up the string everywhere it runs into a space. you can further expand this by requesting it split where ever it finds other characters. Example split.(".") would split the string anywhere it found a period.*
