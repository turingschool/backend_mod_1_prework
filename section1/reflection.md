## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

  * The link to the SuperLearner Article didn't work, so I search google for the article and found this one (https://pubs.ppai.org/pc-today/six-habits-of-super-learners/). The article has some great points about learning and continual learning. It reminded me how I felt at my old job - that I wasn't learning anymore. Hence, I decided to learn something new, and it feels that coding is a continual learning journey, whereas some professions may have a dead end. One of the items on the list that I already do is read. I love reading articles on a range of topics. Philosophy is a topic that resonates since I enjoy learning the meaning of things. I like the point of by teaching others you remember 90% of what you learn. Repeating something you learn is something I picked up when I studied psychology in undergraduate but had forgotten. I can't think of anything not on the list that I would add at the moment.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

````
p "Hello World!"
````

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

  * The # character (hash, pound, octothorpe, etc.) is used to indicate comments in the ruby file.

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

  * An integer is a whole number (ie, 0, 1, 2, etc.), while a float has decimals (ie, 1.2, 2.53, 3.82, etc.).

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

````
animal = "zebra"
````

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

````
p animal
````

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

  * Interpolation is including a variable in a string.
````
p "The #{animal} has stripes."
````

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

  * gets or gets.chomp

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
  * One common string method is .length() to determine the length of the string. Another common string method is .split() to split the string into an array.
