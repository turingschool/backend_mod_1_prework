## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
I realized that I need to start getting comfortable teaching the content that I have learned. If I can help teach a section to some of my classmates that might be stuck it will help cement the exercises in my mind.
1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
`puts "Hello World!"`
1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
 #
1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
An integer is a whole number while a float has a decimal attached
1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
`animal = "zebra"`
1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
`puts "#{animal}"`
1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
Interpolation is when you imbed a variable into something like a string
`puts "My favorite animal at the zoo was the #{animal}."`
1. What method is used to get input from a user?
gets.chomp
1. Name and describe two common string methods:
empty will check to see if your string is "empty" has no values within it
interpolation will allow you to imbed an already defined value into a string
