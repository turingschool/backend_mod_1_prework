## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

* This article resonated with me, but I didn't know that these were the simple (but not easy) habits of a "super learner."
* Things I already do: read a lot, treat learning as a process, teach others what I know when I can, and I take short breaks.
  * It felt like I wasted years of my life studying math and biology in college, but that knowledge has helped me innumerable times in the most unexpected ways. Luckily, the exprience with cladograms in biology really helped me through learning how to navigate files in the terminal!
* Things I want to do better: adopt a growth mindset, take care of my brain (better)
  * Sleep is important. Food is important. Resting is productive. I am trying to improve the quality of all 3 in my own lifestyle habits, and the results have been positive.
* I would add that super learners are always learning more than one thing at a time. While in this class, I am also brushing up on my Spanish by trying to read a book entirely in Spanish, and learning to play my dulcimer. I am also reading two books. I love learning things together, because I feel I can make connections more quickly within and among the subjects I'm studying.

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

p "Hello World!"

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

 # The Octothorpe is the first character of the line, denoting a comment

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

* An integer is a whole number. A float is a number that can only be represented as a fraction or decimal.
  * I am still curious how irrational numbers (numbers that can only be represented by a fraction) work in this context. What is to be done about pi and phi?

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

animal = "zebra"

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

p animal

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

Interpolation is the direct insertion of variables into a sentence.

p "That isn't a horse! It has stripes! My friend, that noise you heard is definitely a #{animal}!"

8. What method is used to get input from a user?

gets.chomp requests (requires) information from the user

9. Name and describe two common string methods:

string.length outputs the number of characters contained within the string
string.split outputs the string in split format, displaying the string as an array
