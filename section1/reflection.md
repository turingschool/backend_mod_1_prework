## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
* Couldn't open linked site, responding to [this](https://medium.com/personal-growth/6-habits-of-super-learners-63d466a254fd) article in the hopes that it is similar.
* Teaching what you know is one of my favorite learning methods, I created study groups in any class that gave me difficulty and explaining concepts to others really helped to cement them for me. Reading a lot is going to be a necessity, and the prep work from Turing has already gotten me in a process/growth mindset. This won't happen overnight and it won't happen at all if I don't do it every-night. I would love if diet advice through some trigger warnings before dropping this stuff on us. I'm sure these food are helpful, but as someone with disordered eating I am going to keep my eye on the not starving thing. In the interest of short breaks I have add a pom timer to my computer.
