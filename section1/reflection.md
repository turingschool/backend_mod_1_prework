## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

The super learner article really opened my eyes. There were a few things that I do and a lot that I don't. The fact that learning should be viewed as a process really resonated with me because we never stop learning. There is always more to learn. What I already do is take short breaks often. It keeps me more engaged. Something I'd like to add to this list is to avoid procrastinating. Like, just jump in and do it, don't be scared/avoidant.  

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
Interpolation is when you substitute the result of ruby code like a variable #{variable} in the middle of a string.
puts "My favorite animal is #{animal}!"

gets or gets.chomp

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
.length = This method tells you how many characters including spaces are in a string.

.split = This method breaks your string into parts.
