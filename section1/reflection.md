## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
* There were a few things in the article that resonated with me - especially points 4 and 6. I love teaching other people things that I know. For two reasons specifically, the first being that I love to share knowledge with people and second the saying "to teach is to learn twice" is very true. Teaching gives people the ability to see a concept through a different lens. Everybody learns differently and as a teacher your job is to figure how to present concepts and information in a way that someone else other than you will be able to understand it.

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
```ruby
puts "hello world"
```

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
```ruby
# then hashtag is used to indicate comments and (cmd + /) will comment out a highlighted section.
```

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
* an integer is a whole number such as 7 or 222. A float is a fractional number or a number with a decimal such as 2.6 or 40.0.

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
```ruby
animal = "zebra"
```

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
```ruby
puts animal
```

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
* interpolation is using a variable within a string.
```ruby
puts "lions really like to chase #{animal}"
animal = "zebra"
```
8. What method is used to get input from a user?
* the method syntax is `gets.chomp`

9. Name and describe two common string methods:
   1. .length - counts the amount of characters in a string
   2. .upcase - capitalizes all characters in a string.
