## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

  The part that resonated the most in that article is that Super learners read a lot. In my free time i do plenty of reading and when i'm driving or at the gym i listen to audio books about personal growth. As a member of a book club, we pick a book to read during the week and we share our thoughts and reflect on what we've learned from it.

  I would like to take more short breaks. In my research, i'd read about the _Pomodoro Technique_ which i'm very interested in trying out for at least a week then reevaluate.

  Super learners are curious. Their desire to learn about new things enhances the learning process and makes it more enjoyable.
