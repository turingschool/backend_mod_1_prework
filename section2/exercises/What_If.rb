# Study Drills
# 1. if executes the code below it in the case where the logical comparison is
#    true
# 2. Indenting under the if statement makes the code more readable
# 3. Removing the indentation does not appear to affect execution
# 4. Example of not equals comparator
people += 1

if people != dogs
  puts "People are not dogs."
end

# 5. Changing the initial values of cats, people, and dogs will alter what is
#    printed to the terminal based on the conditionals
