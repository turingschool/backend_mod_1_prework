# Study Drills
# 1. if makes a statement.  If the statement is true puts is printed in the terminal.  If the statement is false it moves to the next if statement.
# 2. The code under `if` needs to be nested between `if` and `end`
# 3. if `code` is not indented, it does not print to the terminal
# 4. yes we can put boolean expressions
# 5. if I change the intila values for `people`, `cats`, and `dogs` the if_statements will run with the new values.
