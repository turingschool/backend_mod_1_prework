# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section2/exercises/methods.rb`

# Example: Write a method that when called will print your name:
def print_name
  p "Severus Snape"
end

print_name

# Write a method that takes a name as an argument and prints it:
def print_name(name)
  p name
end

print_name("Albus Dumbledore")

# Write a method that takes in 2 numbers as arguments and prints
# their sum. Then call your method three times with different arguments passed in:
# YOUR CODE HERE

def sum(a,b)
  p a + b
end

sum(2,2)
sum(4,3)
sum(100,150)

# Write a method that takes in two strings as arguments and prints
# a concatenation of those two strings. Example: The arguments could be
# (man, woman) and the end result might output: "When Harry Met Sally".
# Then call your method three times with different arguments passed in.

def interpolate_strings(string1, string2)
  p "#{string1} is cooler than #{string2}"
end

interpolate_strings("mac", "pc")
interpolate_strings("ice", "fire")
interpolate_strings("2", "1")

# PART 3: Naming is Hard
#-------------------


# Naming is notoriously hard in programming. It is a skill to name a variable or function concisely enough that it is reasonable to type, but descriptive enough that others can infer the meaning.

# Look at the code you wrote for the previous YOU DOðŸŽˆ - what did you name the function, and why?
# What did you name each parameter, and why?

# EXPLAIN:
## I named the method 'interpolate_strings' because it is descriptive to the functionality of the method.
# The method name indicates what will be returned upon invocation.
## I named the parameters 'string1' and 'string2' because they are descriptive to the exact data type that should be passed in as actual arguments upon method invocation.
