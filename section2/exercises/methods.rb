# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section2/exercises/methods.rb`

# Example: Write a method that when called will print your name:
def print_name
  p "Severus Snape"
end

print_name

# Write a method that takes a name as an argument and prints it:
def print_name(name)
  p "#{name}"
end

print_name("Albus Dumbledore")

# Write a method that takes in 2 numbers as arguments and prints 
# their sum. Then call your method three times with different arguments passed in:
# YOUR CODE HERE
def add(a, b)
  p "Finding the sum of #{a} and #{b}"
  return a + b
end

age = add(50, 1)
height = add(70, 9)
weight = add(103, 26)

puts "James Potter is #{age} years old, #{height} inches tall, and weighs #{weight} lbs."


# Write a method that takes in two strings as arguments and prints 
# a concatenation of those two strings. Example: The arguments could be 
# (man, woman) and the end result might output: "When Harry Met Sally".  
# Then call your method three times with different arguments passed in. 
def partners(man, woman)
  p "When #{man} Met #{woman}"
end

partners("Harry", "Sally")
partners("Adam", "Eve")
partners("Ron Weasley", "Hermione Granger")

# PART 3: Naming is Hard
#-------------------


# Naming is notoriously hard in programming. It is a skill to name a variable or function concisely enough that it is reasonable to type, but descriptive enough that others can infer the meaning.

# Look at the code you wrote for the previous YOU DOðŸŽˆ - what did you name the function, and why?
# What did you name each parameter, and why?

# EXPLAIN:
# I named the function partners, implying a grouping of two people.
# Also it leaves room for people who prefer the term partner over couple.
# Each parameter was a first name or a first and last name. They are unique and within strings in ().
# Harry and Sally were in the instructions. Adam and Eve are two people.
# I chose Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger to continue the Harry Potter theme.
