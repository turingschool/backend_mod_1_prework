# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section2/exercises/methods.rb`

# Example: Write a method that when called will print your name:
def print_name
  p "Severus Snape"
end

print_name

# Write a method that takes a name as an argument and prints it:
def print_name(name)
  puts "Albus Dumbledore"
end

print_name("Albus Dumbledore")



# Write a method that takes in 2 numbers as arguments and prints
# their sum. Then call your method three times with different arguments passed in:
def numbers(a, b)
  puts "First number is #{a}"
  puts "Second number is #{b}"
  return a + b
end

sum = numbers(5, 7)
puts "The sum of numbers is #{sum}"

variation_1 = numbers(4, 21) - 5
puts "Variation 1 minus 5 is #{variation_1}"
puts ""

variation_2 = numbers(11, 10)
puts "Variation 2 is #{variation_2}"
puts ""

variation_3 = numbers(27, 93) / 3
puts "Variation 3 divided by 3 is #{variation_3}"
puts ""




# Write a method that takes in two strings as arguments and prints
# a concatenation of those two strings. Example: The arguments could be
# (man, woman) and the end result might output: "When Harry Met Sally".
# Then call your method three times with different arguments passed in.

# PART 3: Naming is Hard
#-------------------


# Naming is notoriously hard in programming. It is a skill to name a variable or function concisely enough that it is reasonable to type, but descriptive enough that others can infer the meaning.

# Look at the code you wrote for the previous YOU DOðŸŽˆ - what did you name the function, and why?
# What did you name each parameter, and why?

# EXPLAIN:
# In my naming conventions, I was very direct. When I was asked about the sum of numbers, I used numbers as the method and a as the first number and b as the second number. Then I used sum and variations 1, 2, and 3 to name the sum and the variations.
# As with the names, I wanted to use the names of dogs so I folled a numeric dog labeling. As for the arguments, I used name 1 and 2 because it made sense to me and I figure that anyone reading my test could understand it.
