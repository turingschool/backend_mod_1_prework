# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section2/exercises/methods.rb`

# Example: Write a method that when called will print your name:
def print_name
  p "Severus Snape"
end

print_name

# Write a method that takes a name as an argument and prints it:
def print_name(name)
  p name
end

print_name("Albus Dumbledore")

# Write a method that takes in 2 numbers as arguments and prints
# their sum. Then call your method three times with different arguments passed in:
def sum(num1, num2)
  p num1 + num2
end

sum(1, 2)
sum(2, 4)
sum(10, 22)

# Write a method that takes in two strings as arguments and prints
# a concatenation of those two strings. Example: The arguments could be
# (man, woman) and the end result might output: "When Harry Met Sally".
# Then call your method three times with different arguments passed in.
def names(name1, name2)
  p "#{name1} likes #{name2}."
end

names("Khoi", "Kathy")
names("Duy", "Ashley")
names("Han", "Ryan")

# PART 3: Naming is Hard
#-------------------


# Naming is notoriously hard in programming. It is a skill to name a variable or function concisely enough that it is reasonable to type, but descriptive enough that others can infer the meaning.

# Look at the code you wrote for the previous YOU DOðŸŽˆ - what did you name the function, and why?
# What did you name each parameter, and why?

# EXPLAIN: I shortened number to num, because I felt that like would be easily understandable
# and then added a digit to differentiate between the two variables. It's identifiable that they're
# different but also describes what the parameter is expecting.
