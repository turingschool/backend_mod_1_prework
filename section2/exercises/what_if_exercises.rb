# Study Drill Questions
#
# 1. I believe the statement(s) under the if statement is activated if the if statement is true
#
# 2. I believe that is simply to make the code easier to read
#
# 3. Per my testing of this, nothing different happens.
# 
# 4. No, because I don't know what exercise 27 was...
#
# 5. Then my puts may or may not run depending on how the if statements evaluate
