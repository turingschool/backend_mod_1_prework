## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
# It kind of depends on the level of confusion that has hit me, if its just plain gibberish or seemingly contradictory, then I'll ask near immediately after limited research. However, if I think I have a grasp for it, but still just not quite there yet, then I'll hold off on asking questions for a good bit longer.
### If Statements

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
# It is a logical statement asking whether a value meet the rules set in a block determining whether the statement is true or false.
# if today is monday, then I really dont want to do any work.
# If its raining, then bring an umbrella
# If your battery is lower than 20%, find a charger
1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
# Its a faster method to go thru criteria in a collection of information than going thru one by one
1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
#"    if
#     end       "
1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
# by adding "elsif"'s
1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

if day == "monday"
    puts "I ain't doing any work."
  elsif day == "friday"
    puts "Let's get this work done fast, I wanna get out of here."
  else
    puts "Let's get to work."
end

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
# not at the moment
### Methods

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
