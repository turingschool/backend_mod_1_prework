## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
  Personally when it comes to asking questions I'm one to wait to long. The fear of being judged by peers is a strange feeling.
  I wan to be able to go through Turing and my career being brave and not worry of judgement.

### If Statements

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

  A condition in coding is a step that creates a Branch in your code.

  if 5 > 2

    puts "5 is greater"

  elsif 5 < 2

    puts "5 is not greater no Bueno"

  else

    puts "I got nothing"
  end   

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

  I feel you want to make statements to push your program in different directions
  based on output or input from the user.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

if code here

  puts "Statement"

elsif


else


end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

If you are adding another condtion elsif and else help your statements

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

if


elsif

else

end

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

some other great condtionals are <=, <, >=, >, &&, ||


### Methods

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

Methods are a way for you to have a chunk of code that can be called upon to implment

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello()

  puts "Sam I am"

end

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)

  print "#{name} I am"

end


1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

In your program you would call hello_someone

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
  I am currently working on how to take user input as an argument
