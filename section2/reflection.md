## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
`I try to ask them when I think of them.`

### If Statements

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
`A conditional statement is a statement that can be checked for truth. Examples "if, elseif, else"`
1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
`You might want to use an if-statement if you have multiple possible results.`
1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
```
if
  x = y
  p "Statement"

end
```

`use elsif and else statements.`
1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

if
  x = y
  p "Statement"
elsif
  x = z

end
```
1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
`an unless conditional`
### Methods

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
`a method helps repeat a statement quicker and easier`
1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```ruby
def hello
  puts "Hello world"
end
hello
```
1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
``` ruby
name = "Matt"
def hello_someone
  puts "#{name I am}"
end
hello_someone
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
`hello_someone`
1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
`I think I have it.`
