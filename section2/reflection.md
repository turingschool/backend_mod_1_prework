## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
- I have always been hesitant on asking questions because I feel my pride is always telling me no. As the years go on though I've gotten better with asking questions without being hesitant whether people will think I'm done or not. With that being said I ALWAYS wait to long for a question. I can be working on a problem for hours and have the pride not to ask questions but as soon as a I do I realize how much of a fool I was because it was answered in a matter of minutes.

### If Statements

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
- A conditional statement is are used to add branching logic to your programs; they allow you to include complex behavior that only occurs under specific conditions. Examples of this would be if you were giving conditions such as the game from the examples earlier. Proving that conditional statements are true such as in a program when there are several options and multiple answers that cause what if questions. Another example would be if the integers are replaced and need to know if they are greater than or equal to some of the values and variables identified. If they meet the criteria that was made. All these examples can be found in the exercises folder with exercises 1 - 3.

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
- You want a what if-statement if there are multiple routes in the answer or maybe the variables can be disputed and changed which can change values.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
- if people < cats
  puts "Too many cats! The world is doomed!"
end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
- You can add multiple conditions by adding elsif and else
to the if-statement which will give it more conditions.

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
- if zombie == "1"
  puts "You are an angel helping your fiend, but die."
elsif zombie == "2"
  puts "You are either a coward or a psychopath that survived but must live with that guilt."
else
  puts "Well doing anything else such as % results in no pain or gain." % zombie
end

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
- Other than if-statements the use of logical operators with it can help other ways of using conditional statements.

### Methods

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
- A method is made to bundle a group of statements that seem repetitive in a stack to slim it down to a single line of code to use.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
- def print_hello(print_hello)
  puts "Sam I am"
end

print_hello("Sam I am")

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
- def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am."
end


1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
- I would have to identify what the name was and set the variables below to what the name would be to equal name = something then have to identify name(given_name) to make sure the name is identified in the sentence. It can get the name and know to run it.

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
- Is there more method types or are we learning just a few? Also will be practice this more in detail because even thought I feel I have the general idea I feel it can be explained more ande when to use it better.
