## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
  * When we first started Mod 0, I was really nervous to ask questions openly to the class on Slack. Some other students seemed to be way more advanced, but with encouraging from my instructors, I got more comfortable asking questions in the Mod 0 Slack channel.
  * I’ve definitely gone down the Google search rabbit hole, and because I’m new to coding, a lot of the forum results don’t quite make sense to me just yet. It’s also possible that I don’t know the technical terms to refine my search results.
  * I am getting more comfortable asking questions though. Not asking could limit what I can learn, waste time, and make me less productive. Asking questions after 20-30 min of trying to solve on my own will help me be a better communicator, troubleshoot with others, and help me learn.
  * I tend to ask questions too soon. I'm trying to get in the habit of giving myself a 20 minute timer or really being stuck and Googling before I reach out for help.

### If Statements

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
  * A conditional statement evaluates if something is true or false, such as ==, >, >=, <, and <=.

2. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
  * An if-statement creates branches so that if a certain choice is made, it's followed by certain other code.

3. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
  * if conditional
      code...
    elsif conditional
      code...
    else
      code...
    end
    
4. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
  * Use if, elsif, and else

5. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
 ```weather = 'rainy'

    if weather == 'sunny'
      p "sunscreen"
    elsif weather == 'rainy'
      p "umbrella"
    elsif weather == 'snowy'
      p "coat"
    elsif weather == 'icy'
      p "yak traks"
    else
      p "good to go!"
    end
```

6. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
  * Conditionals can be used to compare values in order to return true/false.

### Methods

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
  * Methods are a way of defining and organizing variables that may have different values.

2. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```
def hello(x)
  p x
end

hello("Sam I am")
```

3. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

```
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end
```

4. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
`hello_someone("Caroline")`

5. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
  * So the purpose of line 66 would be that when line 71 is run, it calls the method on line 65 and then does line 66 or whatever else is before the word end?
