# In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
# to achieve the desired result.

# Two examples are already completed. Your task is to complete
# any remaining prompt.




#-------------------
# PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
#-------------------

# EXAMPLE: write code below that will print an array of animals.
# Store the array in a variable.
animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
print animals

# EXAMPLE: Write code below that will print "Zebra" from the animals array
# YOUR CODE HERE
puts animals[0]

# YOU DO: Write code below that will print the number of elements in array of
# animals from above.
puts animals.length

# YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
# array to "Gorilla"
animals[2] = "Gorilla"
print animals
# YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals[3] = "Aussie"
print animals
# YOU DO: Write code that will print the String "Elephant" in the animals array
animals << "Elephant"
print animals
puts animals[4]

#-------------------
# PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
#-------------------

# YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
fruits = ["strawberry", "mango", "blueberry", "orange"]

# YOU DO: Write code below that will print the number of elements in the array of
# foods from above.
puts fruits.length


# YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
# print the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
fruits << "broccoli"
p fruits
# YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
# print the changed array to verify that item has been removed
fruits.delete_at(4)
p fruits

# YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  # There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
# Then, print the changed array to verify the new items have been added
fruits << "dragonfruit"
fruits << "apple"
fruits << "pineapple"
p fruits
# YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
fruits.delete_at(0)
p fruits
#-------------------
# PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
#-------------------


# Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
# This is why programming languages have arrays!

# One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
# associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list, or, array.

# The post itself likely has more complex data, but here is one way we can think about it:


posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

# YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
# may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
# all from the same one.

# 1: NHL alltime stats
# 2: Bikepacking routes in North America
# 3: Online shopping with price lists
