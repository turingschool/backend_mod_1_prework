# In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
# to achieve the desired result.

# Two examples are already completed. Your task is to complete
# any remaining prompt.




#-------------------
# PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
#-------------------

# EXAMPLE: write code below that will print an array of animals.
# Store the array in a variable.
animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
print animals
puts "\n"

# EXAMPLE: Write code below that will print "Zebra" from the animals array
# YOUR CODE HERE
print animals[0]

# YOU DO: Write code below that will print the number of elements in array of
# animals from above.
puts "\n"
puts "-" * 10

print animals.count

# YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
# array to "Gorilla"
puts "\n"
puts "-" * 10

animals[2] = "Gorilla"
print animals
# YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
puts "\n"
puts "-" * 10

animals[3] = "Humuhumunukunukuapuaa"
print animals

# YOU DO: Write code that will print the String "Elephant" in the animals array
puts "\n"
puts "-" * 10

animals[4] = "Elephant"
print animals[4]
#-------------------
# PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
#-------------------

# YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
foods = ["apple", "mango", "steak", "potato"]

# YOU DO: Write code below that will print the number of elements in the array of
# foods from above.
puts "\n"
puts "-" * 10

number_of_elements = foods.count
print number_of_elements

# YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
# print the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
puts "\n"
puts "-" * 10
# Imma be a little difficult in this solution and go the long way, so as to not
# repeat the same method as above
last_slot = (number_of_elements)
foods[last_slot] = "broccoli"
print foods


# YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
# print the changed array to verify that item has been removed
puts "\n"
puts "-" * 10

foods.pop(1)
print foods
# YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  # There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
# Then, print the changed array to verify the new items have been added
puts "\n"
puts "-" * 10

foods += ["pickles", "fajitas", "chili"]
print foods



# YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
puts "\n"
puts "-" * 10


foods.delete_at(0)

print foods


#-------------------
# PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
#-------------------


# Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
# This is why programming languages have arrays!

# One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
# associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list, or, array.

# The post itself likely has more complex data, but here is one way we can think about it:


posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

# YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
# may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
# all from the same one.
