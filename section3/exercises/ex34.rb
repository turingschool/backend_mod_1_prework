#  Zed's instructions are awful in this section....like, his explanation is confusing to me; I don't think I've ever seen anyone use the terms
# cardinal or ordinal when referring to the index of an Array or any collection in the tutorials; they always assume knowledge of a collection beginning at 0 for
# the language being discussed, unless it's an outlier language that is indexed to 1.

# at this point it's a reflex to know that Arrays are indexed to 0, and there are better resources out there to introduce new programmers to this idea, IMO

# STUDY DRILLS
# because day 0 is part of the new collection
