# Study Drills

# 1) With what you know of the difference between these types of numbers,
# can you explain why the year 2010 in "January 1, 2010," really is 2010
# and not 2009? (Hint: you can't pick years at random.)

# -- Because of the way our Gregorian calendar is set up.  There is no year 0.
# Thus, it's been 2010 years (ordinal, start at 1), not 2009 years (cardinal, start at 0).
