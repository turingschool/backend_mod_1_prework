## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
   * Reflecting on the process of coding being crucial for advancing skills resonated with me, becasue I think that's what my approach has been since I want to find a deeper understanding of what I'm doing.
   * Also not being afraid to seek help from a growth mindset is something that resonated with me. I keep seeing this a lot, to be willing to ask for help. I have to try to overcome that fear and just reach out when I'm out my limit of understanding.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
   * I understand that mistakes are a part of the growth mindset. I see them as failures for a time, but ultimately, it's a learning experience.
   * The main way I don't demonstrate a growth mindset would definitely be seeking help. I've always been one to do things myself. I feel as though I should be capable with my own hands, to prove to myself that I can do anything I put my mind to.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
   * A Hash can be seen as a dictionary. You can give it a key, can be a simple word, and you can attach a meaning to it, a value.
   * It differs from an Array, which is just a collection of items, in that the items in said collection aren't assigned a value, the item is the value (?)

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
```rb
pet_store = {
  cat_food: 600,
  dog_food: 750,
  beds: 40,
  treats: 200
}
```

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
```rb
states["IA"]
```

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
```rb
states.keys
states.values
```

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
   * Another example a hash might work would be a menu that would have keys associated with a price.
   * I believe a hash would work better here, because you can connect two differing objects to one another rather than having them separated.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
   * I currently don't have any questions about hashes.
