## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

* The concept of ZPD (Zone of Proximal Development) was first introduced to me in the very first
blog post by Kristen Villanueva. I was familiar with the idea of constantly striving to push yourself a little further for improvement and further challenging yourself, but I had no idea it was given such a scientific and somewhat measurable title. I think I'll find this to be helpful in tracking my improvement through smaller, more attainable steps and challenges.

* I like the overall correlation drawn between developing a growth mindset and learning to program.
Villanueva stresses how important practice, problem solving, critical thinking, systematic thinking and other technical, mental processes are to learning code, and I think most people would never guess that these processes and techniques also apply to developing a certain mindset. You can read all of the self-help books you want, stumble upon epiphany after epiphany, but will ultimately miss out on substantial and long-lasting improvement unless you actively practice implementing what you've learned in your daily life through strategy, mistakes, and analysis. Our minds are so malleable. If we start thinking about expanding our threshold of knowledge and self development in this scientifically formulated way, it might seem just a bit more tangible!

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

* I would like to believe that I actively practice a growth mindset in every aspect of life...and while I truly feel like I try my best to do this, I am sure there are areas where I don't do as good of a job as I think. This may be the opposite for some people, but when it comes to big events in my life that don't go as planned, I have a very easy time applying a Growth Mindset to the situation and going with the flow. I rarely get upset, and it's easy for me to see it as a learning opportunity or adventure. A funny example is when I set out on my own for the first time in Spain to go hiking in the mountains. I thought I knew how the buses worked and which one to take...which ended up not being the case. The very last stop the bus made was at a prison in the middle of nowhere, two hours outside of Madrid (my home). I had no choice but to sit outside of the prison, set up camp (a blanket, a box of granola bars and some cheese sticks), and wait for the next bus to swing by 2 hours later and take me back into the city. It sounds silly, but I really didn't mind. I spent 2 hours journaling about everything I observed and how different my surroundings were to the surroundings I was used to back in the states. I also swear that s'mores granola bars taste better when you're lost and on an impromptu adventure.

* On the other hand, it can be the opposite for smaller, less significant events in my life. A common example for me is cooking and baking. Somehow I always get something wrong, and I never see it coming. (You'd think I would know by now). It throws me for a loop every single time, and instead of analyzing my errors taking note for next time, I can become exhausted and very discouraged. I'd like to practice improving my growth mindset in smaller situations like this.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

* A hash is a selection of key-value pairs.
* You can only use numbers to call something out of an Array, while you can use anything as your index while using a Hash.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

`pet_store = {hamsters: 7, beta_fish: 10, parakeets: 8, crazy_cat_ladies: 2}`

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

`puts states["IA"]`

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

* `puts states.keys`

* `puts states.values`


1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

* We might use a hash when assigning students to their new teachers/classrooms for the year. A hash may be better than an array because the index is not restricted to just numerical values.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?

* In what instances would you want to include nil and why?
