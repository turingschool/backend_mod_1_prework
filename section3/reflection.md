## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

Mistakes are essential and don't be afraid to ask for help are the two that resonated with me most. Because those are the two that I struggle with.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

Currently, I believe that I do a good job of seeking out challenges and love to get feedback. Again, I struggle with asking for help but I'm making a point of trying to help change that.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

A hash is a way to store data, like a list with almost anything.

A array is for an ordered array of items. A hash is for matching "keys" to "values".

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

pet_store = {collars: 3, leashes: 11, brushes: 5}


1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

puts states.fetch("IA")

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

puts states.keys
puts states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

If I needed to collect contact information of name, date of birth, city, state, and zip it would make sense to use a hash. This would allow me to map specific keys that are relevant to my values.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
None at this point as I am still trying to wrap my head around it all.
