## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
* Firstly, the idea of a fixed view, that the person you are today is the person you will always be. That you are constantly changing as you learn.
* Secondly,to strive to push ones zone of proximal development

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
* I'm not afraid to ask questions
* settin my SMART goals effectivly.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
* Hashes are similar to arrays, but hashes have keys that are connected to values. you can call on them values using their key. arrays have a limited kind of things that can be listed in them, hashes do not.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
```
pet_store = {
  'chew_toys' => '15',
  'leashes' => '21',
  'puppies' => '13',
  'kittens' => '8',
  'dog_food' => '10',
  'cat_food' => '14',
}
```

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
* print states["IA"]

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
```
print states.keys
print states.values
```

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
* Websites and their daily traffic
* Hashes do not have a set order, this allows them to easily be called on by their key and changed of their value if desired.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
* How does IHOP make theirs just so darn good????
* (no)
