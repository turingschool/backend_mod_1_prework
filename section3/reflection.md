## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
    * Growth mindset vs fixed mindset.   In a fixed mindset we believe that our capabilities are fixed.  In a growth mindset we know that life is a continual learning process.
    * When I am facing a problem or struggling: 1) make a mental list, what am I ACTUALLY struggling with, 2) turn it into a plan with action steps.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  I currently demonstrate a growth mindset by learning coding with Turing.  This is absolutely new to me but I know that I can continue to learn.  For me it takes time and practice.  

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array? A hash is a list/collection of key: value pairs. An array is a list.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

```rb
pet_store = {dog_beds: 7, aquariums: 3, litter_boxes: 2, dog_bones: 15, cat_toys: 18}
```

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

`puts states["IA"]`

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
`puts states.keys`      `puts states.values`
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
example: a great example of a hash is a name: phone number list.  Every name goes with that person's phone number.  Other wise, if we used an array, we would not know who's phone number is who's.
1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
   I have so many questions about hashes.  This has been the hardest section so far.  But I keep practicing! I just learned how to add to/modify a hash.
