## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I believe having a Growth Mindset that revolves around setting goals and creating an action plan, is the first step to take in order to grow any skillset. Along the way, mistakes will be made but practicing self-discipline is key. Having a Growth Mindset is all about the person’s approach towards a difficult situation. It is done is by taking a step back and understanding that everyone struggles at first and not let doubt control one’s actions. It is normal to feel demotivated whenever we are dealing with a new challenge but recognizing these feelings and being aware and in control is essential because the next time we encounter the same feelings, we can handle the situation in a more strategic way. In general, life is a learning process but having a growth mindset means that we can shield ourselves from anything that life throws at us and move forward.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

The way I currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset is through practicing self-discipline and self-awareness. I realize that going back to school to learn coding is going to be very challenging. I’ve accepted that in order to be successful for the next 7 months, I needed to have a learning mindset that would keep me motivated and prevent me from giving up. I’m learning to set Smart goals and stay away from distractions.

Ever since I was little, I’ve always been very competitive. In my mind, that was my way of motivating myself to do better next time. That mentality always came with a heavy price. The emotions that came with defeat created this pressure that sometimes I didn’t know how to handle. By doing this exercise I came across a book called “Mindset” by Carol Dweck.  I’m learning not to compare myself with others and that success through continuous improvement can be achieved in a more healthy way.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

  A hash is a collection of data that is organized into key-value pairs. In an Array we access its elements via the index since they are in sequence where as the elements inside a Hash are not in any order and can be accessed via the keys to get the value.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

pet_store = {"dog food" => 10.99, "cat food" => 8.99, "pet toys" => 5.99}

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

p states["IA"]

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

p states.keys

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

A hash is used when we have to store a collection of data and the order isn't important since it takes time to scan the data to figure out the Index position when we have an Array.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
