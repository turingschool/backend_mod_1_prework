## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
Something that really resonated with me was this idea that in coding, without a challenge there is no work. Basically the work is figuring out these challenging problems and that's the reason you have the job, which means the whole point is that it is hard and it's okay for to feel hard, but don't let that deter you. I also just really appreciate the idea of a growth mindset and that who we aren't isn't fixed and that we can learn and grow.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_? I think I demonstrate a growth mindset in that I'm always trying to find solutions. If I'm struggling with something I want to fix it and I see most things as fixable problems that I have some control over. I think where I struggle is asking for help from others. I liked that in the reading they talked about seeking help as a sign of strength, and I'm going to try and start looking at it in that way.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array? A hash is a data set that has key-value pairs and you can you use the keys to access data in the hash. Arrays are also data sets, but arrays are indexed by integers and ordered.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
pet_store = {"dog food" => 150, "cat food" => 200, "goldfish" => 75, "dog collars" => 90, "cat nip" => 110}

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
states["IA"]

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
states.keys
states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array? We could use a hash to store names with email addresses. The key would be the person's name and the value would be their email address. It would be better than an array because you could easily look up by name with a hash, but in an array you would have to look up the values by an index number and it wouldn't be paired with the person's name.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
