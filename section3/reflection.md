## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
```
As a former "gifted kid" a lot of things came easy, but when things didn't I would give up early. By realizing that it takes practice it helped me realize that I will pick it up with time. Also I've been working on trying to figure out why things work, which involves figuring out what doesn't work.
```
1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
`I've been trying to make sure I seek out help when I can't figure out something on my own within a reasonable amount of time.`
1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
`Arrays are used to store elements of one type, while hashes are used for elements of various types.`

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
```ruby
pet_store = {
  rabbits: "15",
  cats: "5",
  dogs: "7",
  dry_food: "50",
  wet_food: "30"
}

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
`p states["IA"]`
1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
`p states.keys, p states.values`
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
`A hash could be used to store information from an email. A hash is better because it can store different types of information.`
1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
`none currently`
