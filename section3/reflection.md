## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
The "ZPD" was a new phrase but sounds similar to the idea of working within your reach successfully in order to grow outside that reach.  I also like and am familiar with setting SMART goals for success.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I do try to focus on the process and I understand that a part of the process is making mistakes.  However, I still struggle to seek help because I have had a lot of final responsibility for outcomes.  I am growing and have the desire to grow in this area though.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
Arrays are ordered while Hashes are unordered

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
pet_store = {leashes: 12, birds 25, guppies: 30, turtles: 7, lizards: 4}

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
puts "#{states['IA']}"

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
p states.keys
p states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
When searching on Google it's better to have data in Hashes because the searches are random and it would take longer to theoretically to retrieve using an Array.
1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
