## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?  

   It was good to hear that you can have a mix of fixed and growth mindset in life. In some aspects of life it may be better to have a fixed mindset or there may just be a day that you are stuck in a fixed mindset. Not shaming yourself if you have a day or week that you are stuck in the fixed mindset. However, allowing yourself to go through that and holding yourself to getting back into a growth mindset.

   Another point that stuck out to me was part of the explanation of the different in a fixed and growth mindset. For the growth mindset it was mentioned that who you are today isn't who you will be tomorrow. It was an exciting thought thinking about all the changes in may life right now and how I will definitely be a different person 7 months from now.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?  

   Today there were two points from the article that I recognize I do today. I very much believe that you can improve with effort and practice. Anyone can learn something new with effort and practice. I recognize that how proficient someone is after putting in the effort and practice will be different but you still will have learned something you didn't know before. That also goes hand in hand with focusing on the process. As I practice more I can find new, different, or better ways of doing something.

   The biggest way I do not demonstrate the growth mindset is asking for help. That is one area I am going to have to work on during Turing. I will work myself mad trying to get something done on my own.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?  

   A Hash is a variable with multiple variables in it. It allows you to group together a number of different data types under one. This is different from and Array because and Array is only one variable with multiple data types in the list.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.  

```ruby
pet_store = {
  raw_hide: 25,
  bully_stick: 30,
  chew_toy: 60,
  food_bowl: 10,
  water_bowl: 8
}
```
1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?  

```ruby
puts states['IA']
```


1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?  

```ruby
p states.keys
p states.values
```

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

   A hash can be used anytime you have a list of data that you also want some corresponding information on. You could use a hash to show different information about a sports team {mastcot, win record, salary cap, ect.}. A has is better than an array because you can get more information from it.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?  

   I don't have any other specific question on hashes at this time. It will be good to continue to familiarize myself with hashes and other uses.
