## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
* Goal setting needs to be much more concise and measurable than what I am used to.
* Getting comfortable expanding your current level of understanding or (ZPD) will help you become a better programmer.
1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
How I do
------------
* Focus on the process of programming
* Constantly strive to set challenges

How I don't
------------
* Set SMART goals
* Not being afraid to seek help
1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
A hash is similar to an array but it allows you to set definitions for values rather than just positions in a list.
1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
`pet_store = {'dog toys' => 200, 'cat toys' => 100, 'tiny fish tanks' => 20}`

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
`puts "#{states[IA]}"`
1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
`puts states.keys`
`puts states.values`
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
You could use a hash when looking for a phone number on a user's contact list. The hash would be better since you could pull the number with a value (person's name) rather than needing to find its position amongst all the other numbers in the contact page.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
Too many, but we will start with this: Why would arrays ever be used over hashes if hashes offer more functionality?
