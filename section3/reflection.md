## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  1. Seek challenges to help improve coding and also encourage/build confidence for challenges in the future.
  2. Tracking where you started and your progress along the way helps you see how far you've come; acts as motivation/encouragment.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  - I don't think I've struggled much academically/professionally much.  I am a quick learner and have very quick information acquisition skills. I think I will have to work on a growth mindset in terms of feeling like I'm failing when I get stuck because I'm not used to being stuck in learning/working.
  - I love to learn and to make myself better. I want to challenge myself and figure out different ways to do things.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
  - A hash is a collection of data where each element is addressed by a name; unlike an array, its order does not matter.
1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
```ruby
pet_store = {
  gold_fish: 207,
  beta_fish: 32,
  bearded_dragon: 7,
  containers_fishfood:  27,
  crickets: 407   
}
```
1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

`puts "#{states[IA]}"`

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
`puts states.values`

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
  - A hash could be used to catalogue my list of Turing vocabulary words and definitions. A hash allows you to assign a key/word to the value/string where an array assigns a position within the array. For a list of words/definitions, important to know which def goes with each word.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
  - Compared to our initial discussion of hashes during Session 4, I feel a lot more confident.  I need to practice more as I still frequently forget important syntax pieces as I'm typing (the commas when the keys/values are on separated by returns, accidentally using an = instead of a hash rocket =>, etc.)
