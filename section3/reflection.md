## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- S.M.A.R.T goals is something I recently came across and have been trying to to improve.  In the past I always had issues with creating goals and when i did they were always too far ahead.  This led me to getting down on myself when I didn't achieve them in a timely fashion or the impending feeling of it being too far out o reach would discourage me.
- This one always seems to be overused but it is the truth.  I learn a lot more from my mistakes rather than my successes.  Especially in education my mistakes or incorrect answers have always stayed with me longer than the times when I was correct right from the beginning.  It's important to fail in life it is how we truly learn.  There is also a lesson in what we do with that failure to make sure we succeed in the future.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- I currently learn a lot from failure.  I also tend to always want to stretch my knowledge.  This suggests that I tend to be eager to learn new things or techniques.  
- I don't show a growth mindset in the way when it comes to questions.  I don't tend to ask many questions even if I'm not 100% sure of what I'm doing.  I know it something I have to work on because I don't know all the answers but I rely on my ability to figure it out later.  This does not always turn out positive though.  

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
- A Hash allows you to store multiple different types of data.  You can have both integers and strings in a hash.  Whereas in an array they must all be the same type.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

```
pet_store = {
  chew_toys => 1000,
  treats => 3000,
  leashes => 200,
  brand_food => 'Pedigree'
}

```

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
- `p states["IA"]`

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
- all keys: `p states.keys`
- all values: `p states.values
`
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
- An example would be profiles on a website.  A hash would be more according because of the need of different data types that are required in a profile.  They aren't all integers or all strings.  A hash would be more suited to fit everything you need into it.  

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
- I'll do more research into this but I learned the pros towards using a hash over an array.  My question is, is the only benefit of an array over a has is that an array is ordered? It just kind of seems like why even use an array over a hash? This could just be from my lack of experience with hashes and arrays.
