## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- One thing that resonated with me is that when I was a child I had a fixed mindset drilled into me, and this hampered my development considerably! By adopting a growth mindset, I am now extremely adept at things that I would have been considered incompetent at in the past.
- The other thing that resonated with me is that I have since devoted myself to developing a growth mindset and have taken on several skills that a younger version of myself would be shocked to learn I that have acquired or strengthened!

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- I demonstrate a *growth mindset* by constantly trying to improve my important skills and attempting to take on new ones. The best example is my sociability after years of being told I was just anti-social.
- One way that I do not demonstrate a growth mindset is by sticking to the old ways I used to conduct myself because for a long time I was convinced that I was incapable of changing. An example of this is my disinterest in trying out new things like dancing and board games.

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
- A **hash** is used to store key-value pairs of information in any order, where the keys are unique. An **array** is an ordered collection of information. While an index number can be used to call information out of an array, the key is necessary to call information from a hash.

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
```rb
pet_store = {
  'Food' => 25,
  'Bedding' => 20,
  'Toys' => 50
}
```

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
- The value "Iowa" would be accessed by calling `states["IA"]`.

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
- The keys and values can be retrieved with `states.keys` and `states.values` respectively.

7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
- We may use a hash to store user data, so that we may better manage their information on a website. Using a hash would allow us to retrieve specific pieces of data on command, while an array would store a list of information without labels.

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?
- I would like to know how hashes can be implemented into a program so that the information can be utilized to provide custom recommendations for a user based on their input.
