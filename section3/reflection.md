## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

    + In the article one of the things that stood out to me and is something that I haven't heard of was S.M.A.R.T goals. I do set goals but they tend to be general and I don't normally set how they are measured. I like S.M.A.R.T. as a guideline for setting goals especially with tracking time and making it measurable. I see this as something helpful and will use in the future.

    + Another point that stuck out to me in the article is being open to feedback and suggestions. It can be hard to receive feedback or suggestions sometimes, but it is incredibly important for growth. I would describe myself as someone who has more of a growth mindset than a fixed mindset. In my last job there came a point in time when I stopped receiving feedback or my feedback was just "that looks good". Since I wasn't getting any feedback about my work I stopped wanting to move forward and grow and became stagnant. Since I wasn't getting feedback I wasn't sure if I should improve the process or try something new. I think feedback is essential to growth.   

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

    + One way that I demonstrate a growth mindset now is that I am constantly striving to get better and learn from my mistakes. When something goes wrong or doesn't work, I always try and work through the problem and figure it out instead of giving up. Sometimes I need assistance with my problem but I never want to just quit.

    + One way in which I don't demonstrate a growth mindset is asking for help. I am willing to accept help but I struggle asking for help. I tend to want to work alone when it comes to solving problems but I need to reach out and ask others for help. Even on a personal level, when I struggle with something I don't like asking for help because I think I need to figure it out myself. This is not a good mindset and I know that I need to work on. Hopefully I can with this program.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

    A hash is like an array in how it is a list of data but the main difference between a hash and an array is that the hash also holds definitions. A hash is like a dictionary. In a hash there is a key (similar to a value) and a definition associated with the key.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

    ```ruby
    pet_store = {
      'dog food' => '20',
      'cat food' => '35',
      'dog toys' => '47',
      'cat beds' => '12',
      'fish bowls' => '7'
    }
      ```

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

    You would access Iowa by the function: `states["IA"]`.

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

    To print all the keys you would use: `states.keys`. To print all the values you would use: `state.values`.

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

    Hashes may be used to pull data about the weather. You could see a listing of multiple places along with their temperature. You wouldn't be able to list the combination of places and temperature in an array.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?

    I don't have any specific questions about the basics of hashes or why they are used in code. I am sure there is still more information that needs to be learned. Using nested hashes may get confusing but for now I understand the concept.
