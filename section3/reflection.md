## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
    The constant learning is a big point for growth mindset. If I'm not learning something how am I growing.
    Practice. The need to practice is key to keep the skills sharp for any task.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
    I really am always trying to learn something. Most of the youtube videos I watch are educational in soome way. I really crave new facts

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
    An associated key value pair that is used to keep information organized. The use of a key and value makes them different from arrays. You can access the value by using the key. Arrays are only index and dont have keys

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
    ```ruby
    pet_store = {
        cat_food: 5,
        dog_toys: 4,
        fish_tanks: 7
    }
    ```

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
    `states["IA"]`

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
    `states.keys`
    `states.values`

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
    When you need to keep a more complex data set organized and usable. With an array you have to remember the order of the info in the array in order to get to the item you want. A hash lets you call on that info by name.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
