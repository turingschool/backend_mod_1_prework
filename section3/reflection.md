## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
<br> Seeking out challenges with a growth mind set resonated with me because it really takes me out of my comfort zone.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
<br> I demonstrate the growth mindset by not being afraid to ask for help. I don't demonstrate a growth mindset by seeking out challenges.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
<br>A hash has a value and a key but an array does not. An array just has an object inside.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
<br>```rb

pet_store = {catnip: 25, dog_bones: 50, bird_feed: 35, girbil_ball: 22 }

```

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
```rb

p states["IA"]
```

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
```rb

states.keys
states.values
```
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
<br>We might use a hash when objects in the hash has a value and a key. It's better than an array because it's more than just an object.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
<br>Does order matter in a hash? would methods that work for arrays work for hashes?
