## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  * S.M.A.R.T. - Setting Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound goals is a model that would be extremely helpful for me to keep in mind. I think those are good questions to ask at the outset of any project, and even ask again later as the project progresses.
  * The importance of accepting mistakes as part of the learning process really resonates with me, especially when coupled with reflection and iteration to cement the skills being practiced.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  * I already have a tendency to seek out challenges, but I also tend to find myself outside the ZPD. I think it's important for me to learn how to pick appropriate challenges. I am also pretty willing to ask for help, but I think I could stand to do so a bit sooner than I usually do.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
  * A hash is a collection of data, like an array, but the elements in a hash do not have a defined index or position. Arrays elements can be called using the index position starting with 0, while data stored in a hash is called using a key.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
```ruby
pet_store = {
  guinea_pigs: 6,
  fish: 135,
  puppies: 3,
  kittens: 0
}
```

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
  * `states["IA"]`

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
  * `states.keys` `states.values`

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
  * listing trails in an area would be a good place to use a hash
    * A hash is better in this instance, because it allows you to call specific information about the trail such as difficulty, feet of ascent, and notable features. The trail names themselves could be the name of the hash, and the hashes can exist in an array of trails.  

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
  * I don't have any specific questions, I mostly need to work on syntax and practice combining hashes and arrays like we do in the hashes.rb exercises. I imagine I will have more questions as I continue to explore.
