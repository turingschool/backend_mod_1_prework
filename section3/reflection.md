## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I liked the idea of setting SMART goals (Setting Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound goals). I typically do set goals for myself, but setting SMART goals would be even better. Typically I don't have a due date on my goals, but setting SMART goals would force me to set actual dates for the goals I want to achieve. This would likely lead to me getting my goals done faster. I remember learning about ZPD in my psychology classes many years ago. It was nice to revisit and brush up on this concept. This essentially just means I need to continue to push myself out of my comfort zone to get smarter and better at coding.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I typically do not get discouraged when I face failure. I understand this is just part of the process of growing. If you aren't failing at coding then you probably aren't learning anything new. I could do a better job at setting SMART goals and reaching out for help when I need it.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
Arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections.
Hashes are collections of key-value pairs, and the values can be words not just integers.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
```
pet_store = {fish: 18, dogs: 5, cats: 10}
```

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

```
print states.values[1]
```

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
```
print states.keys
print states.values
```
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
```
wardrobe = {shirts: 18, shorts: 30, shoes: 6}
print wardrobe
```
This data is good for a hash because the order doesn't really matter, and I wanted to store key value pairs

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
I need more practice manipulating hashes (adding variables, removing them, etc) but don't have any questions.
