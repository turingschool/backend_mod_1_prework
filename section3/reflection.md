## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
I appreciated the emphasis on how making mistakes is a **large** part of the process of learning. I believe in the Mod 0 orientation video Jeff said "If you're not struggling you're wasting your time." That struggle allows one to grow beyond their current skillset.
I liked in the video where the interviewee mentioned that whenever they are engaged in struggle, they will reflect where their skillset was previously and how much that skill has grown. This mindset seems to provide a cycle of struggle, reflection and growth that provides momentum.


1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I'm fairly comfortable jumping into a problem that I may not have all the answers to; in addition, making mistakes (at least when it comes to code) doesn't phase me. This allows me to consistently confront what I don't know and then engage in active struggle to overcome a problem; however, I still have much work to do in terms of setting and framing goals that are *"Setting Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound [SMART]"*. This tracking of goals would be a great way to have a standardized way of keeping track of progress and give insight into growth over time.


1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
A hash is a data structure composed of key/value pairs. These pairs can be composed of any data type and a programmer can pull either keys or values from the data. What matters in a hash is the *relationship* between each pair. Arrays are composed of a list of data where each location is indexed by a number. These are useful to iterate on.


1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
```
pet_store = {dog_food: 101, fish_food: 50, cat_toys: 300}
```


1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
`states['IA']`


1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
`states.keys` and `states.values` respectively.


1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
```
rating = {1: "30%", 2: "45%", 3: "60%", 4: "80%", 5: "100%"}
```
In the above example a programmer could more easily manipulate the key numbers in code while reporting out their associated values which are more human readable. An array has no such functionality of this equivalence.


1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
Curious to learn more about Object Literals...
