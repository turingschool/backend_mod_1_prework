## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

   * The two that resonated with me the most are to seek out challenges and believe in yourself.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

   * I currently break large tasks down into smaller sub-goals and focus on both what worked and what did't work. One area I need to improve on is asking for help in a more timely manner.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

   * A hash is a collection of key-value pairs. It matches items (keys) to values. It differs from an array by not being ordered. Also, it can assign values from within whereas an array just stores values.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

   * `pet_store = { dog_food: 354, cat_food: 325, dog_beds: 54, scratch_posts: 25, }`
  
1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

   * `states["IA"]`

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

   * `states.keys` and `states.values`

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

   * You could use a hash for a grocery list. It would be better than an array because you could assign a quantity to the items you need (example: {tomatoes: 12, bananas: 6, doughnuts: 12}) rather than just a list of items with no values (example: ["bananas", "tomatoes", "doughnuts"]).

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?

   * What else can we do with hashes? Are hashes more commonly used than arrays or are they about the same?
