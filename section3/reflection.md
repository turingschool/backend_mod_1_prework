## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
Grit, focus and self-reflection are the only route for how to improve in coding.
1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
Developing a framework for my goals
1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
A hash is an assosiative list whereas array is a list
1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
```ruby
pet_store = {:dog_collars => 46, :dog_food_bags => 56}
```
1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
`p states[:IA]`
1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
`p states.keys`
`p states.values`
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
Movie ratings and it is better as a hash because there needs to be pairs of the movie and then movie rating. Making it into an assosiative list.
1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
How to iterate over nested hashes.
