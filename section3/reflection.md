## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- S.M.A.R.T. goals - setting Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound goals will help break down large coding problems into manageable subgoals which will overall improve strategy and process of learning how to code.
- Track your own progress when working on something and don't compare yourself to others in order for learning how to code (or whatever growth for that matter) will become less daunting.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- Ways I demonstrate a Growth Mindset are seeking out challenges, reflecting on the learning process, and understanding that making mistakes is part of the process. Ways in which I do not demonstrate a Growth Mindset are easily asking for help, breaking down goals into manageable subgoals, and documenting my progress.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
- A hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. We can assign values to keys so that values can be looked up by their key. Hashes have certain similarities to an array but an array index is alway an integer and a hash key can be (almost) any object.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
`pet_store = {"dogs" => 12, "cats" => 16, "fish" => 30, "rabbits" => 3, "snakes" => 7}`

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
`states["IA"]`

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
`states.keys`
`states.values`

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
- We could use a hash to hold translation information, for example English words translated to Spanish. This hash would contain keys that would be the English word, and values that would be the corresponding Spanish word. A hash is a much better container for this information because it assigns values to keys, allowing us to contain more information and allowing us to look up values assigned to their keys.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
- Should values and keys of hashes have a character limit?
