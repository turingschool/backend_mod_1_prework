## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
+ SMART Goals are great, I have used them successfully in the past.
+ Accept mistakes as essential to learning; I need to work on this.
1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
+ I currently demonstrate Growth Mindset by working on iterative process improvement; I'm always looking to make a process a *little* better
+ I currently do not demonstrate Growth Mindset in understanding there is always room to grow; I want to attain Mastery so I don't have to work hard anymore. Now I think Mastery is a dynamic process and not a state of being.
1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
+ A Hash is a mapping of unique **keys** to specific **values**
+ An Array is always indexed by an integer, a Hash key can be *almost* any object
1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
+ `pet_store = {collars: 10, leashes: 15, brushes: 20}`

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
+ `states["IA"]`

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
+ `states.keys`
+ `states.values`

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
+ Data pertaining to an email would be better stored in a hash than an array, because the values will probably be a mix of Strings and numerics that we would want to index by unique keys and probably not integers

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
+ What objects in Ruby may not be used as Hash keys?
