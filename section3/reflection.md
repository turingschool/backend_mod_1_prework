## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

S.M.A.R.T.

Setting Specific
Measureable
Achievable
Relevant
Time-Bound goals

I think it's important to break down learning how to code in bitesize chunks. We won't know how to hack the mainframe by tomorrow. Also, it's important to remember that we will make mistakes and that's okay.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I think I demonstrate a Growth Mindset by being willing to tackle any challenge and not giving up until I've given it my best shot.  Something I can work on is _not_ waiting so long to ask for help in tackling that challenge.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

In an array, you can only use numbers to find out what's in arrays. In a hash, you can store anything by associating one thing to another (also referred to as "mapping").

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

pet_store = {'1' => 'dog food', '2' => 'dog toy', '3' => 'fish'}

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

puts states['IA']

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values? {"key" => "value"}

states.keys
# output is ["CO", "IA", "OK"]

states.values
# output is ["Colorado", "Iowa", "Oklahoma"]

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

You can use a hash for anything. In a hash, you can add new things into the hash with strings.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?

I notice that ' and " are sometimes used interchangeably. What is the difference between them and are they used interchangeably?

I don't understand the use or purpose of `nil` as an output.
