## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

- There were two points that were brand new to me that I found interesting upon reading. They were the acronyms SMART and ZPD. SMART stands for "Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Reasonable, Time-Bound". This is a way of setting goals, and by practicing this way you can learn with clarity, focus and use of appropriate strategies. ZPD is "Zone Proximal Development". The concept of challenging yourself by learning and pushing a little beyond what you've already mastered. This is most useful, especially in coding.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

- One way that I could be demonstrating a growth mindset is my process of reflection. In terms of ways i do not demonstrate, it could be down to my inability to ask questions comfortably. It didn't occur to me that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. I always thought it was the other way around.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
- A hash is a collection of key value pairs that can be assigned to one variable. Array's are ordered, collections in a list labelled by indexes.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
- pet_store = {
    'fish_food' => '30',
    'goldfish' => '12',
    'parrots' => '5'
}

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

- states.values_at(:IA)

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

-states.keys
-states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

- Another example could be when we make assign "human" to a variable and create key-value pairs with the different attributes associated with them.
- In this case, i think its just easier to use a hash. you can put a lot of information and its easier to read and understand compared to a array.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
n/a
