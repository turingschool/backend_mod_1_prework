## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

   I'm a big fan of acronyms. SMART goals are an idea that I really think I can hang on to and try to improve. "Smart, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time bound." I tend to be a rather disorganized person that just "does" instead of plans, so incorporating this will help me to learn and grow.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

   When I get my mind set on learning something, or have to for a job, I'm very good at making sure to put in regular effort and practice. From 2013 to 2015  I was in the military's Defense Language Institute: their school for interpreters and translators. I was tasked with achieving fluency in Arabic in less than two years. I never would have been able to do this if I did not dedicate myself to constant gradual improvement through hard work and constant practice. I graduated with a degree and have held it as a point of pride ever since.\

   However, I allow myself to get bogged down by mistakes. When things get really tough, I have the tendency to despair and sometimes quit. This is absolutely a way I do not yet demonstrate a growth mindset. I think in a program like this, I can learn to embrace mistakes as a part of learning.

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

   A hash stores key/value pairs, where each key is unique. Arrays are a collection of data types. Arrays are ordered whereas hashes are not.

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
```ruby
pet_store {
  "Dog Food" => 30
  "Cat Food" => 45
  "Cat Litter" => 25
  "Rat Snacks" => 100
}
```

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
`states["IA"]`

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
```ruby
states.keys
states.values
```

7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

   It would be better to use a hash in a situation where you need pairs of data, like a dictionary term and definition, instead of just a list of terms. It's more useful to use a hash in this situation because you can tie the term (key) to the definition (value).

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?\

   I think it's less about questions and more about putting in the work to get used to them to cement my understanding.
