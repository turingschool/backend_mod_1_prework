## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
* The importance of seeking out challenges, of actively looking for things you know nothing or very little about and learning about them, and how crucial that is to maintaining the "Growth Mindest". Basically, never accepting the status quo, never settling for "good enough" will set you well on the path to success.
* The importance of knowing when enough is enough for one day/task. There will be days/tasks where despite your best efforts, you make little to no progress, feel like you've learned nothing, or just struggled the entire day. "Tomorrow will be better." Don't carry your burdens with you to the next day/task. Fresh day, fresh mindset.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
**DO**
* Seeking out challenges. Realizing I was working a job that was going nowhere fast, that was the definition of "good enough" and realizing I wanted more from life, and from myself...so I turned to Turing, and every challenge this program provides me.
* Understanding that mistakes are critical to learning. You don't know what you don't know. The only way to figure out you don't know something is to fail at it, realize how/why you failed, and figure out a way to succeed based off how you failed. Failure is the first step to success, the first step to knowledge.

**DO NOT**
* Setting SMART goals. I for sure have a tendency to tackle a task by just charging headlong into it and trying to knock it out in one fell swoop. That is a recipe for disaster, for burn out, for small mistakes that will inevitably catch up to me and potentially defeat the entire exercise.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
* Hashes and Arrays are similar in that they both contain and store data/object/values, but differ from one another in one key element: how they organize and store said data. Arrays organize the lists of items stored within them via numerical values, while Hashes organize the data stored within them via `Keys`, words directly associated with whatever item one wishes to store.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
` pet_store = {dog_food: 12, cat_food: 15, dog_leashes: 28, dog_toys: 329} `

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
```ruby:
 # states[:IA]
 puts "I've never been to #{states[:IA]} before, though I'd like to go!"
 ```

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
`states.keys`, `states.values`

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
* If you were tracking the inventory of your fridge to build a grocery list for the week, organizing the contents of your fridge into a a hash would be preferable to an array as you are more concerned with the quantity of a specific item in your fridge than you are which item comes first, fifth, or 33rd.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
* Hashes seem pretty cool. Just like the ability to create your own methods, a hash feels like it has endless application and is a very powerful tool. I wouldn't say I have more questions, more interested to see/learn what sort of applications/things you can truly do with hashes.
