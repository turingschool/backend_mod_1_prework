## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?  
* Don't worry about others. Everyone learns at their own pace. Only keep track of your own progress.
* If you do not look back at where you came from you have no perspective.  
* The idea of a fixed mindset vs and growth mindset. Having these ideas named and defined makes identifying, and possibly correcting, my own mindset easier.  

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?  
* I have always been taught that I can learn whatever I want to learn. It is only a matter of time and effort. In terms of learning I am fortunate to have already been raised with a growth mindset.  
* I think I have a fixed mindset about some of my own characteristics. I can rationally understand that I can change pretty much anything about myself an my personality however it often does not feel that way.  

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?  
Hashes are unordered pairs of things. You can assign any variable any key. Arrays are ordered pairs of things. The things in an array can be accessed by it's specific number in the array.  

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.  

`pet_store = {dog_food => 10, cat_food => 8, dog_toy => 5, cat_toy => 6}`


5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?  
`states["IA"]`

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
`states.each |abbrev, state|`  
I am unsure what this means by 'get all the keys and values'. The (incomplete) snipped above would iterate through each pair in the hash and take in both the key and value for each pair. From there the code can be completed in the best way for whatever  scenario.  

7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?  
*Anything that can be paired! Month/year, name/age, last_name/first_name.
*I don't think hashes are better than arrays, they are just a different type of tool. Hashes are better at arrays for things that can be paired. Instead of assigning something to an ordered number like in an array you can assign it to a more relevant key. I think array would be better for things that need to stay in order.  

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?  
I'm at the point where I get what hashes do, however I don't see the whole picture yet so I don't know what questions to ask... if that makes any sense.
