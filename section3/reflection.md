## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- Two points from the growth mindset and the video are that a person should never compare themselves to one another and to focus on your own progression. For someone like me I am constantly comparing myself who are either the best in their fields or have years of experience. Such as me wanting to already compare myself to someone that has been coding for years. I base my progress to them which is slightly lobsided due them already having that head start plus it diminishes the work I have put in almost. It's good to have an idol or a person to look up to but comparing just puts weight that is unneeded and diminishes the work put in. I just learned that the Growth mindset can be learned by anyone wether you are just changing careers or what to learn a new hobby you can learn new hobbies but putting in the effort. No matter the background or if you have a 'gift' working hard and repetition of not giving up and fighting through all the hard ships.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- I demonstrate a growth mentality by never backing down from a challenge. Even though I might complain about a challenge I never back down from it. I may fail at something but I always learn from mistakes when something doesn't work it means another way must be found for it to work. I will always complete something that is handed to me. The way in which I don't have a growth mindset is the way I compare myself to others. By doing this I am always putting myself down which is bad to see how far I've come in which hurts my growth.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
- A hash is different from a an array because an array is ordered collection of objects while a hash is a collection of key-value pairs meaning there is no order in the hash.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
- pet_store = {leashes: 75, dog food: 507, treats: 250}

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
- p states.values_at("IA")

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
- Below is the code to get all the keys.
abbrev = states.keys
puts abbrev

- Below is the code to get all the values.
full = states.values
p full

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
- An example of using a hash would be when there are no values or integers being used. For example using friend1 to represent someone rather identifying that person with a number we can use the index just friend. Using this can be more beneficial when indexing rather than keep using numbers which then keep having to be increased do to how many objects are being used causing to use numbers everywhere.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
- I think so far hashes are okay in my book I know there is several way to index and utilize different methods with hashes but I know ruby.docs has many different methods in there to depict how to utilize hashes.
