## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
    * I took away a lot of good points from the blog and the podcast. I think the one of the most important takeaways though was to track your own progress. When I began my career in the music industry, I was always comparing my work to that of people who were way above me in the industry. Whether it was actual artists or simply mixes from a live perspective, everyones always seemed better than mine. And they were much better, but that was because they had been doing it for 10-15 years more than me. It seemed super daunting and demotivating every time i would try to sound like their work. Over time i developed the same method of just tracking my progress. Seeing where I was and were I had gotten to. It felt like in no time after that, I had met or exceeded the people that I was looking up to. Another major takeaway from the reading that stems from this is that there are two mindsets, and you get to choose which one you want to be in. Do I want to be a the fixed *fixed* mindset or the *growth* mindset? I think for most people, the growth mindset is where we want to be. It's easier said than done though. It can be hard when you are faced with a problem that has taken so long to overcome and it feels like you haven't gotten anywhere for hours or even days. It's important though to know that even though you aren't making progress on the problem, you are making progress in the ability to overcome and learn.
2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
    * Currently I think understanding that I am far from understanding code language and even still, more simple ideas of code, is not how it will be forever. I am working towards a goal and know that the more time and effort I put into learning, researching, breaking and understanding code... the closer I am getting to my goal. And I know I'm making progress every single day. Every time I open terminal and get stuck, I am making progress towards where I am trying to get. I think some way that I do not demonstrate the growth mindset is by giving up too early sometimes. Sometimes just before a breakthrough. I might give up on a problem. I will always revisit it but sometimes I get frustrated and just need to get away for a little bit.
3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
    * A has is a way to store data, but unlike an array, you can store any type of data within a hash. You can then pull from a hash like a database.
4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
```Ruby
pet_store = {
  1: 'dog food',
  2: 'cat food',
  3: 'leashes',
  4: 'bones'
```
5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
states|IA|
```Ruby
puts states['IA']
```

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
```Ruby
puts state.keys

puts state.values
```
7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
   * One thing would be when access a users data when posting to a platform like facebook. The hash would hold the variables:
    1. image/video file
    2. time of the post
    3. users description of the post
    4. comments
    5. Number of likes
    6. shares


8. What questions do you still have about hashes?
