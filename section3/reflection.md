## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- I feel that the points they made in the blog really do help you master an area in your life.
1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- I currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset by challenging myself. Avoidance is never the answer. I am not great at asking questions if I feel like it is a bad question.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
- A hash is a collection of data by keys instead of indexes like an Array.
1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
`pet_store = {frogs: 2, dogs: 2, snakes: 3, cats: 4, bears: 0}`
1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
`states["IA"]``
1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
`states.keys`
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
- You might use a hash to create a dictionary. A hash is better because you can pair information instead of just
- creating a list.
1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
- I want to learn more about how to use them with iteration
