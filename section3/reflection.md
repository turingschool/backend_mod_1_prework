## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
The two things that resonated with me were seeking out challenges to learn/improve on something, and knowing that it is okay to make mistakes/mistakes are how we learn to get better at something.
1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I demonstrate a growth mindset by being willing to jump into a challenge to figure it out/learn how to do something. I'm okay with failing continuously to try to figure something out and know that the process to learn is key to learning. I think where I do not demonstrate a growth mindset is in setting SMART goals, i am not very good at setting SMART goals and really struggle with that.
1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
A hash is a collection of "keys" and their "values" a key is usually the name of an object in the hash i.e. "mountain_name" and the valuen would be "Pikes peak" Hashes are not ordered and cannot be indexed like an array. Arrays are ordered lists that can be indexed, but have less flexiblity for assigning values than a hash.
1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
pet_store= {
  "dog food"=>5
  "cat_food"=> 6
  "dog_bed"=>9
  "cat_toys"=>6
}
1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
using the code states["IA"]
1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
to get all the keys we would do p states.keys for the values it would be p states.values
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
We may want to use a hash when wanting to have all the data for a National Park (like Yellowstone) available to use for a program, in this situation where there are strings, booleans, intergers, and floats all for the same thing a hash is useful to use to store the data becuase we are able to store all these different data types for that one subject together. This also allows us to better define the data we are saving with the program so that we can pull things like the Park name, size, or if we can camp there easily from accessing it in the hash.
1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
I am not sure if I have any at this time
