## Section3 Vocabulary
- Hashes:  Also known as `objects` in `JavaScript` or `dictionaries` in `Python`, are a data type that hold key/value pairs.  These can include nested data types as well (arrays, sub-hashes, etc.)

- Keys:  These are the `address` of data within a hash. They are __unordered__ and __unique__

- Values: These are the `data` stored at the `address` __(key)__

- Arrays:  These are ordered lists of items (`elements`), which are accessed numerically by their `index` (position within the list). The first item in an array is __index 0 (not 1)!__
