# pomodoros for 6/9/21
### pomodoro 1: 25 minutes
* determine current place in progress
* complete the `mod zero hero` challenge
* complete the annotation challenge

So always, when working, the challenge is: what was I working on? Where did I stop? And what do I need to do to begin, again?

I was going to go through everything again. And that's because I was looking at the section that said to re-factor. I've already re-factored section4. I was adding more words and input to the reflection in section4. Read that again. But I'll do that after I complete the other two items. Then i'll work back through section3, 2, 1.
