## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
I have rushed through all of the prework because I waited until the last moment to start, so I haven't taken the opportunity to really try the Pomodoro technique.
1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
I found myself forcing myself to continue to work even when the pom goal was met.

1. In your own words, what is a Class?
A class is the basic outline of an object. It can have attributes and behaviors.

1. What is an attribute of a Class?
An attribute is information about a class.

1. What is behavior of a Class?
A behavior is an action that a class can take or have done to it.

1. In the space below, create a Dog class with at least 2 attributes and 2 behaviors:

```
class Dog
  attr_reader :gender, :name,

  def initialize(gender, name)
    @gender  = breed
    @name   = name
  end

  def growl
    p "GRRR!"
  end

  def eat
    p "Chomp chomp"
  end
```

1. How do you create an instance of a class?
`instance = Class.new`

1. What questions do you still have about classes in Ruby?
The overall concept of a class as a mold for instances makes sense to me.
