## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

  * I took a lot more breaks with the Pomodoro technique. I paced myself with the exercises and took a 2-3 minute break after every 15 minutes when I went thru the materials or worked on a problem. When I got stuck on a problem, I took a longer break (10 minutes or so) to relax as well as do a bit of reflecting.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

  * The work around setting intentions in Step 1 went relatively well. While I did take breaks, when I was on a roll, then I would continue to work through the problem. I need to continue to practice the Pomodoro technique. I was surprised that when I got stuck on an exercise (ie, the ````burrito.rb```` file) a couple of times, I took a long break and refreshed a bit and then went back to google and found what I was looking for. I felt a bit more focused than if I tried and power through longer to work on the exercise.

1. In your own words, what is a Class?

  * A Class is a guideline of an object that contains attributes and maybe some action or behavior that the Class would do.

1. What is an attribute of a Class?

  * An attribute is a specific property of an object that would describes what a particular Class is.

1. What is behavior of a Class?

  * A behavior of a Class would be an action that a Class would do.

1. In the space below, create a Dog class with at least 2 attributes and 2 behaviors:

````
@name = dog_name
@breed = dog_breed
@play = play_activity
@hungry = true
````

1. How do you create an instance of a class?

  * You create an instance of a class by assigning a data point to the attribute. For instance, below is an example. ````frank```` is assigned to ````Studnet```` class in this example and the ````first_name````.

  ````
  frank = Student.new
  frank.first_name = "Frank"
  ````

1. What questions do you still have about classes in Ruby?

  * I don't have any immediate question about classes, but I probably will and put my questions on Slack!
