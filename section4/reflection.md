## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

The Pomodoro technique is extremely helpful, but I find 25 minutes to be too short. I was using 45/5 increments but I've switched to 35/5 and that seems to work great for me. I try to force myself to stay seated for that 35 minutes but I'm not always successful. I also find sometimes that the Pom timer will interrupt me when I'm in a flow and I want to finish what I'm doing before I take the break. Is that ok, or are we supposed to interrupt the flow to take the break to get the full effect of the Pomodoro?  

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

My intention was to stay seated for the entire 35 minutes. I was mostly successful. I also work much better/faster when I have a deadline to meet, so that has also been helping me to move through the exercises more quickly. It also really helps to put my phone on "Do Not Disturb".

1. In your own words, what is a Class?

A Class is the main category for which all attributes can apply and from which objects (instances) are created.

1. What is an attribute of a Class?

Attributes are the characteristics that apply to the Class.

1. What is behavior of a Class?

Method is a behavior of a Class. Methods define the behavior.

1. In the space below, create a Dog class with at least 2 attributes and 2 behaviors:

```rb
class Dog
  # attributes:
      has_name (boolean)
      fur (string)
      number_of_legs (integer)
      is_hungry (boolean)
  # behaviors:
      go_to_groomer
      feed_dinner
```

1. How do you create an instance of a Class?

Create a specific instance of that Class. For example, Vida is my sister's dog which is an instance of the Class Dog.

1. What questions do you still have about Classes in Ruby?

Yes -- what is the proper syntax of Class and an instance of that Class. I've seen it in so many different formats it's hard to learn the "rule" for syntax.

Questions: "Part A How You Spend Your Time"

1. Have the time estimates matched up with your experience?

At first the time estimates were way off for me. It easily took me 2 and sometimes even 3 times as long as the suggested time. However, I just slammed through Section 3 in half the time, so I think things are starting to click!

1. When you sit down to start working, do you have a clear goal of what you want to accomplish and in how much time? If so, how aligned is that to what actually happens?

I don't usually think about the time limit. I usually just try to get it done as quickly as I can. I think a focus of mine should be not to be perfect and it's ok to make mistakes.

1. How do you work best - in 2 hour blocks, 4 hour blocks, etc? Do you take breaks regularly? Do you have a system to hold yourself accountable to taking breaks?

I do usually take breaks but not intentional and timed breaks. I usually just get up when I want to stretch my legs, get some food, water some plants, etc. or when I feel like I need to take a break -- not when it's dictated to me. Maybe that's something I can work on.
