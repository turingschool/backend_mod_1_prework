## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

  * Considering i had already applied the method to my workflow there was not a big difference. I did however apply the four check mark rule.  

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

  * It went well. I did feel more focused and motivated to complete the task before the timer went out.

1. In your own words, what is a Class?

  * A class is a description of a type of thing. It defines what its attributes do.

1. What is an attribute of a Class?

  * Attributes are the characteristics of a class. They are shared by all the instances.

1. What is behavior of a Class?

  * It determines how an instance of that class operates.

1. In the space below, create a Dog class with at least 2 attributes and 2 behaviors:

```rb
class Dog
  def initialize(breed, name)
    @breed = breed
    @name = name
  end

  def bark
    puts 'Ruff!'
  end

  def introduction
    puts 'My  name is #{name} arf!'
  end
end


```

1. How do you create an instance of a class?

  * An instance of a class is a specific example of the class. Outside of the class method you add an instance.

1. What questions do you still have about classes in Ruby?
