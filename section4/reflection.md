   It went pretty well actually, I never used this method before I can adjust to  making this pernamnent


1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
I found myself more focused when I got rid of all distractions around me.
